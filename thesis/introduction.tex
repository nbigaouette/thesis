Our capacity control atoms and molecules, specifically with light,
will drive the evolution of nanosciences. The method of choice to study 
bio-molecules today is X-ray crystallography, a method that lead Watson and 
Crick on their discovery of DNA's double-helix structure in 1953. 
Unfortunately, only a small fraction of bio-molecules can be crystallized 
efficiently. Additionally, obtaining large amounts of these molecules can be 
challenging in itself. Could it be possible to obtain a diffraction pattern, 
the basis of X-ray crystallography, with only a single one of them? Could the 
measurement be made directly in water droplets as to prevent bio-molecules' 
denaturation during crystallization? Because large amounts of atoms are 
required for normal X-ray crystallography experiments, the X-ray source will 
have to be many times more energetic to get interesting contrast in the 
case of single-molecule imaging. Since X-rays are ionizing, increasing their 
total energy will have unfortunate consequences for the molecule. This 
light-matter interaction will thus set an upper range on the light duration.

Today's X-ray sources such as synchrotrons don't have the intensity and 
duration required for such experiments but new Free-Electron Laser (FEL) are 
able to fill the gap. By sending relativistic electrons through an ondulator, 
one can efficiently control the wavelength of the resulting laser pulse, from 
microwave to X-rays. FEL installations at the Linac Coherent Light Source 
(LCLS) in Stanford and Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) have generated 
ultra-short (femtosecond) laser pulses at ultra-short wavelength and 
unprecedented intensities. By concentrating the energy during a short pulse, 
the light-matter interaction time scale is now on the same order as the 
electrons movement, allowing such pulses to act as the equivalent of a camera 
flash. Such a useful tool can thus be used for probing of molecular 
and, more importantly, electronic dynamics. Multiple images could be assembled 
to reconstruct a molecular movie; studying how a protein is folding has great 
potential for new drug treatment for example.

Light and matter interaction is well understood at the two size extremes: 
single atoms and solid systems. Intermediate systems, like nano-particles and 
bio-molecules, offer greater challenges. To study these, clusters of atoms are 
a useful tool. They bridge the gap between single atoms and solid state 
matter. They are nanoscale objects, ranging from less than ten atoms to tens of 
thousands of atoms or even more. Even though they are small in size, their 
density is close to solid matter and can thus exhibit the same collective 
effects that are present in large scale systems. Additionally, they are easily 
accessible experimentally; simply forcing a gas through a small enough nozzle 
will ``stick'' atoms together and clusters will emerge from the nozzle's pin 
hole. Varying the gas pressure will result in different cluster sizes. 
Clusters normally have a structure in icosahedral shells.
Different combinations of atoms are also possible, for example getting a core of 
one kind of atom surrounded by shells of another element. More importantly for 
the following work is the fact that clusters of atoms are small enough to be 
studied numerically. Complexifying a system by adding more particles will 
result in extra computational burden, so smaller systems are obviously easier 
to simulate. Solving quantum mechanically an atom with many electrons is an 
extremely hard problem. A system composed of dozens of atom is thus intractable 
without using approximations. Keeping the system as small as possible allows to 
reduce to a maximum the number of approximations and stay as close as possible 
to the physical system.

Another interesting aspect of clusters is the relative importance of 
their boundaries compared to their volume. Because the surface of a sphere 
scales as radius squared and the volume as radius cubed, smaller objects can 
exhibit more boundary effects.

Experiments with clusters have shown interestingly large energy absorption 
compared with gas. High energetic electrons (tens of keV) have been observed. 
Ions can also be accelerated to MeV energies and X-rays can be generated by the 
electrons' movement around ions in the cluster.

This brings important questions; do we understand fully how the energy is 
absorbed by the clusters from the laser? How is that energy distributed 
inside a nanoparticle? What are the different mechanisms that play a role in 
the interaction? What is the effect and importance of these mechanisms? These 
are the kind of questions theoretical studies can answer.

Certain heating mechanisms are known. Three of them are of great importance. 
First, single- or multi-photon ionization is the absorption by a bound electron 
of one or more photons which promotes this electron to the continuum. This 
mechanism is dependent on the photon density; higher intensities mean more 
photons which in turns increases the probability of an electron absorbing one 
(or more) photon. The resulting electron will have, as its kinetic energy, the 
remaining between the ionization potential energy and the photon energy. This 
extra kinetic energy is clearly visible in electron spectra obtained from 
experiments.



Theoretical investigations are essentials to open the door to a better 
understanding of ultra-short and ultra-intense laser energy absorption by 
nanoscale objects.
