Our capacity to control atoms and molecules, specifically with light,
will drive the evolution of nanosciences. The method of choice to study
bio-molecules today is X-ray crystallography, a method that lead Watson and
Crick on their discovery of DNA's double-helix structure in 1953.
Unfortunately, only a small fraction of bio-molecules can be crystallized
efficiently. Additionally, obtaining large amounts of these molecules can be
challenging in itself. Could it be possible to obtain a diffraction pattern,
the basis of X-ray crystallography, with only a single one of them? Could the
measurement be made directly in water droplets as to prevent bio-molecules'
denaturation during crystallization? Because large amounts of atoms are
required for normal X-ray crystallography experiments, the X-ray source will
have to be many times more energetic to get interesting contrast in the
case of single-molecule imaging. Since X-rays are ionizing, increasing their
total energy will have unfortunate consequences for the molecule. This
extreme light-matter interaction will thus set an upper range on the X-ray
pulse duration.

Today's X-ray sources such as synchrotrons don't have the intensity and
duration required for such experiments but new Free-Electron Laser (FEL) are
able to fill the gap. By sending relativistic electrons through an ondulator,
one can efficiently control the wavelength of the resulting laser pulse, from
microwave to X-rays. FEL installations at the Linac Coherent Light Source
(LCLS) in Stanford and Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) have generated
ultra-short (femtosecond) laser pulses at ultra-short wavelength and
unprecedented intensities. By concentrating the energy during a short pulse,
the light-matter interaction time scale is now on the same order as the
electrons movement, allowing such pulses to act as the equivalent of a camera
flash. Such a useful tool can thus be used for probing of molecular
and, more importantly, electronic dynamics. Multiple images could be assembled
to reconstruct a molecular movie; studying how a protein is folding has great
potential for new drug treatment for example.

Light and matter interaction is well understood at the two size extremes:
single atoms and solid systems. Intermediate systems, like nano-particles and
bio-molecules, offer greater challenges. To study these, clusters of atoms are
a useful tool. They bridge the gap between single atoms and solid state
matter. They are nanoscale objects, ranging from less than ten atoms to tens of
thousands of atoms or even more. Even though they are small in size, their
density is close to solid matter and can thus exhibit the same collective
effects that are present in large scale systems. Additionally, they are easily
accessible experimentally; simply forcing a gas through a small enough nozzle
will ``stick'' atoms together and clusters will emerge from the nozzle's pin
hole. Varying the gas pressure will result in different cluster sizes
and they will normally have a structure in icosahedral shells.
Different combinations of atoms are also possible, for example getting a core of
one kind of atom surrounded by shells of another element. More importantly for
the following work is the fact that clusters of atoms are small enough to be
studied numerically. Complexifying a system by adding more particles will
result in extra computational burden, so smaller systems are obviously easier
to simulate. Solving quantum mechanically an atom with many electrons is an
extremely hard problem. A system composed of dozens of atom is thus intractable
without using approximations. Keeping the system as small as possible allows to
reduce to a maximum the number of approximations and stay as close as possible
to the physical system.

Another interesting aspect of clusters is the relative importance of
their boundaries compared to their volume. Because the surface of a sphere
scales as radius squared and the volume as radius cubed, smaller objects can
exhibit more boundary effects.

Experiments with clusters have shown interestingly large energy absorption
compared with gas. High energetic electrons (tens of keV) have been observed.
Ions can also be accelerated to MeV energies and X-rays can be generated by the
electrons' movement around ions in the cluster.

This brings important questions; do we understand fully how the energy is
absorbed by the clusters from the laser? How is that energy distributed
inside a nanoparticle? What are the different mechanisms that play a role in
the interaction? What is the effect and importance of these mechanisms? These
are the kind of questions theoretical studies can answer.

Certain heating mechanisms are known. Three of them are of great importance.
First, single- or multi-photon ionization is the absorption by a bound electron
of one or more photons which promotes this electron to the continuum. This
mechanism is dependent on the photon density; higher intensities mean more
photons which in turns increases the probability of an electron absorbing one
(or more) photon. The resulting electron will have, as its kinetic energy, the
remaining between the ionization potential energy and the photon energy. This
extra kinetic energy is clearly visible in electron spectra obtained from
experiments.

Single photon ionization is obviously dependent on the photon's wavelength; if
the photon's energy is not enough to bring the electron to the continuum,
ionization cannot take place. A second heating mechanism though is not
(directly) dependent on the wavelength but on the laser field strength. If the
laser pulse's intensity is strong enough it will bend the Coulomb potential the
electrons are feeling. The electronic wavefunction will thus be able to tunnel
through the potential barrier and the probability of finding electrons
outside their parent atom (or ion), an ionization event, will increase. This
process if called \textit{tunnel} or \textit{field} ionization  since it
requires strong laser fields to happen. Laser intensity and atom type are the
main influence of tunnel ionization and the Keldysh parameter will give
information on whether the process is possible or not. Tunnel ionization is the
heart of the High Harmonic Generation (HHG) process; an electron tunnels out of
its parent ion potential and is then accelerated into the laser field. When the
field polarity is inverted during its oscillation cycle the electron will be
forced back to the parent ion where it recombines, emitting high energy photons.

The two previous ionization processes are dominant at the start of the laser
pulse since they are the only way for the system to absorb energy in the
absence of free electrons. But once free electrons are created by these
processes a third one appear: impact ionization where an energetic electron
collides with an atom or ion and transfer some of its kinetic energy to a bound
electron, pushing it to the continuum.

While not a heating mechanism \textit{per se} (the cluster does not absorb
energy from the laser in this process), free electrons can absorb energy from
the laser during the \textit{Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating} (IBH) process.
Bremsstrahlung is the emission of photons during electron collisions with
heavier charged particles (ions). IBH is simply the opposite: electrons
absorbing photons in the presence of ions and being deflected. IBH is an
important heating mechanism at long wavelength (800 nm for example) while being
marginally efficient at shorter wavelength regimes (X-rays).

The previous processes, while conceptually being simple and elegant, are not
enough to explain high charge states seen in recent experiments at FEL
facilities. Many research groups have proposed new models to
explain the large absorption rates. The older model is called \textit{barrier
suppression} or \textit{barrier lowering} and is conceptually similar to tunnel
ionization. In this model, the potential barrier a bound electron sees will be
lowered by the presence of a neighbouring ion. This has been applied in
simulations to single photon ionization to allow less energetic photons to be
absorbed by electrons in a cluster environment. If the neighbour ion is close
enough, the energy level the electron is sitting at could even become above the
potential barrier between the two ions. In this case, an electron might be
considered quasi-free between the ions.

The second major model is based on \textit{atomic potentials} usage in
simulations instead of pure Coulombic ones. In all but hydrogen (or hydrogenic)
atoms, many electrons are present around the nucleus. Exact solutions (to the
non-relativistic \schrodinger equation) for many electron systems are not known
but are approximated by different methods. For example, the Hartree-Fock
method, used to solve for ground state electronic wavefunctions of a
multi-electron system, uses a mean field created by all other particles. This
mean field could also be used instead of a pure Coulomb one to portrait a more
realistic interaction between a moving electron and an ion.

A third model has been proposed for describing large energy absorption by
clusters. This model is based on the density of electronic states just under
the continuum. There is an infinity of bound states for any potential shape;
the lowest is the ground state which is followed by excited states, many of
which are well defined. But as the level increases, the difference in energy
between them decreases. As the levels get closer and closer together,
distinguishing them becomes harder and it is possible to approximate them, in
simulations, as continuum states instead. This is the basis of the \textit{Many
Body Recombination} (MBR) heating process. An electron could collide with
another electron and loose some kinetic energy, becoming trapped in the ion's
potential or recombined to a highly excited state. Since the difference in
energy between this high excited state and the continuum is small, the electron
could easily absorb a new photon from the laser field and be promoted to the
continuum where the process can start over. This has the net effect of
depositing an extra photon worth of energy into the cluster environment.

The last model, introduced by our group, also explores the quantized nature of
the electronic states. Instead of looking at the highly excited states like
in the case of MBR the lowest energy levels are included as heating mechanisms.
Normally during impact ionization, an electron will need enough kinetic energy
to bring a bound electron from the ground state to the continuum as explained
previously. This put a limit on the number of electrons in the cluster
environment that can participate in such a process; all electrons with
kinetic energy lower than the ionization potential cannot impact ionize an atom
or ion. The novel idea here is to also include these electrons in the process
by letting them transfer some of their kinetic energy, through collisions, to a
bound electron, bringing it to an excited state. Having a relatively long decay
time, these electrons in an excited state can then be transferred to the
continuum by the collision of a second electron. Because the two impacting
electrons don't need as much energy as in the case of impact ionization, many
more electrons can participate in this many-step process. We called this
process \textit{Augmented Collisional Ionization} (ACI).



Theoretical investigations are essentials to open the door to a better
understanding of ultra-short and ultra-intense laser energy absorption by
nanoscale objects.
