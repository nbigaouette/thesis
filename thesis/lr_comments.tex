\begin{itemize}
\item \sout{Cite: Varin2012, Peltz2012. Pre-ionized
clusters. Ultra large clusters: new frontier of modeling.}
\item One or two sentence(s)s at end of 1.1 about wavelength (???)
\item Add more details: context. More on size of clusters, scale. More details
people not familiar with clusters and/or lasers.
\item Add something about Ditmire's 3 step model explaining long wavelength stuff
(ionization, ?, coulomb explosion) --> Cite Ditmire (nanoplasma?)
\item In 1.1, add why laser-solid interaction is important --> LR will send ref.
on dielectrics.
\item We want a general picture for Carleton examiner who will know nothing about
clusters/lasers.
\item Add in section \ref{section:intro:clusters:heating} a reference to
attosecond science and state that we are not interested in that.
\item Top of page 2: add that all work is in femtosecond duration, leading to
attosecond.
\item State that their is two kinds of absorption:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item direct from laser field (photo-, tunnel, etc.)
    \item indirect with help of environment (collisions, IBH, MBR, ACI...)
    \end{itemize}
\item State that this thesis talks about ACI.
\item State that tunnel is at long wavelength, basis for attosecond
\item Change ``heating'' to ``microscopic mechanisms underlying the dynamics''
\item Change organization of heating mechanisms: start at long wavelengths, going
to shorter ones instead of stating each mechanisms.
\item Add a figure showing the different regimes (only for rare gas), intensity
vs wavelength and where each mechanisms is important. See Fennel2010 for a
similar figure. State where my contributions are.
\item Know and state at which intensity multiphoton gets important; I'll get
question on it.
\item \sout{Put table of Ips for Argon and Xenon in 1.2}
\item Add something about the fact that every atoms has its own Ip and is thus
not influence the same way by the wavelength: then it's clear photon needs
enough energy to ionize.
\item Add Bosted2009 ref. about frustration.
\item State that ``1.2.5 - Other mechanisms'' is in the VUV
\item Say something in 1.2 that it's ``well known'' (???)
\item In 1.2.5, add something like ``New experiment in VUV showed interesting
stuff, couldn't be explained. Had to introduce new mechanisms.''
\item In 1.2.6, add ``This thesis will show this''
\item Put recombination paper in, before QFDTD.
\item State that 1.2 is a motivation for the thesis
\item Merge the goals section into 1.2, since it's the motivation
\item Change title of ``1.4 - Thesis Outline'' to ``My contributions'' or
something like that.
\item Section 2.7 - Libraries: State that cross-sections were calculated/obtained
by Eddie.
\item Section 2.7 - Libraries: How are the cross-sections calculated? obtained?
Put this explanation into chapter 2 since it's technical.
\item Add more details on the ionization library in chapter 2 (own subsection).
Say something about the flags?
\item Expand more on the OpenCL implementation since I passes a lot of time on
it: show amount of work. Add a figure of how it works. Show a graph of speedups?
\item Say that QFDTD was used to test the Vb approximation
\item Change ``Conclusion'' to ``Discussion'', expand to ~10 pages.
\item Change ``Final words'' to ``Conclusion'', expand to ~2 pages.
\item Put reference section at the end.
\item Add citations in the discussion.
\item Expand the discussion with more paragraphs.
\end{itemize}
