\SmallAcknowledgements{
What can you see\\
On the horizon?\\
Why do the white gulls call?\\
Across the sea\\
A pale moon rises\\
The ships have come to carry you home\\ \vspace{20pt}
%
And all will turn\\
To silver glass\\
A light on the water\\
All souls pass\\ \vspace{20pt}
%
Hope fades\\
Into the world of night\\
Through shadows falling\\
Out of memory and time\\
Don't say: "We have come now to the end"\\
White shores are calling\\
You and I will meet again\\ \vspace{20pt}
%
And you'll be here in my arms\\
Just sleeping
