The spectral brightness of storage-ring-based facilities increased by three orders of magnitude every 10 years since the 1960s. The extreme peak brightness at single-pass free electron X-ray lasers with pulse durations variable between about 1 and 300 femtoseconds will allow transformative experiments in many areas of science. This article is an attempt to show how progress in accelerator science and technology stimulated advancement in photon science, by discussing a limited number of examples of work at third generation storage ring facilities and free electron lasers. Hopes for further improvements in specific beam properties are expressed.},

With these beam characteristics this light source is capable of imaging the structure and dynamics of matter at atomic size and timescales.

	abstract = {Theory predicts(1-4) that, with an ultrashort and extremely bright coherent X-ray pulse, a single diffraction pattern may be recorded from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into a plasma. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of this principle using the FLASH soft-X-ray free-electron laser. An intense 25 fs, 4 x 10(13) W cm(-2) pulse, containing 10(12) photons at 32 nm wavelength, produced a coherent diffraction pattern from a nanostructured non-periodic object, before destroying it at 60,000 K. A novel X-ray camera assured single-photon detection sensitivity by filtering out parasitic scattering and plasma radiation. The reconstructed image, obtained directly from the coherent pattern by phase retrieval through oversampling(5-9), shows no measurable damage, and is reconstructed at the diffraction-limited resolution. A three-dimensional data set may be assembled from such images when copies of a reproducible sample are exposed to the beam one by one(10).},

	abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded. It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals (∼200 nm to 2 $\mu$m in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage.},

	abstract = {An era of exploring the interactions of high-intensity, hard X-rays with matter has begun with the start-up of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Understanding how electrons in matter respond to ultra-intense X-ray radiation is essential for all applications. Here we reveal the nature of the electronic response in a free atom to unprecedented high-intensity, short-wavelength, high-fluence radiation (respectively 10(18) W cm(-2), 1.5-0.6 nm, approximately 10(5) X-ray photons per A(2)). At this fluence, the neon target inevitably changes during the course of a single femtosecond-duration X-ray pulse-by sequentially ejecting electrons-to produce fully-stripped neon through absorption of six photons. Rapid photoejection of inner-shell electrons produces 'hollow' atoms and an intensity-induced X-ray transparency. Such transparency, due to the presence of inner-shell vacancies, can be induced in all atomic, molecular and condensed matter systems at high intensity. Quantitative comparison with theory allows us to extract LCLS fluence and pulse duration. Our successful modelling of X-ray/atom interactions using a straightforward rate equation approach augurs favourably for extension to complex systems.},

The pulse duration was in the region of 10 fs, and peak powers of 10 GW were achieved. At a pulse repetition frequency of 700 pulses per second, the average extreme-ultraviolet power reached 20 mW. The output beam also contained a significant contribution from odd harmonics of approximately 0.6\% and 0.03\% for the 3rd (4.6 nm) and the 5th (2.75 nm) harmonics, respectively. At 2.75 nm the 5th harmonic of the radiation reaches deep into the water window, a wavelength range that is crucially important for the investigation of biological samples.},

A typical X-ray free-electron laser is a few kilometres in length and requires an electron-beam energy higher than 10 GeV (refs 6, 8). If such light sources are to become accessible to more researchers, a significant reduction in scale is desirable Here, we report observations of brilliant extreme-ultraviolet radiation from a 55-m-long compact self-amplified spontaneous-emission source, which combines short-period undulators with a high-quality electron source operating at a low acceleration energy of 250 MeV. The radiation power reaches saturation at wavelengths ranging from 51 to 61 nm with a maximum pulse energy of 30 microJ. The ultralow emittance (0.6pi mm mrad) of the electron beam from a CeB6 thermionic cathode is barely degraded by a multiple-stage bunch compression system that dramatically enhances the beam current from 1 to 300 A. This achievement expands the potential for generating X-ray free-electron laser radiation with a compact 2-GeV machine.},

	abstract = {X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biological systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions. Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma. The continuous diffraction pattern of non-crystalline objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval. Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Calculations indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample. The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resolution in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage. The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion. We expect that significantly higher resolutions will be achieved in such experiments with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area. The resolution in such experiments can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies.},

Whereas weak laser fields allow the analysis of photoionization, excited-state relaxation, and structural modifications on these finite quantum systems, large-amplitude collective electron motion and Coulomb explosion can be induced with intense laser pulses. This review provides an overview of key phenomena arising from laser-cluster interactions with focus on nonlinear optical excitations and discusses the underlying processes according to the current understanding. A brief general survey covers basic cluster properties and excitation mechanisms relevant for laser-driven cluster dynamics. Then, after an excursion in theoretical and experimental methods, results for single- and multiphoton excitations are reviewed with emphasis on signatures from time- and angular resolved photoemission. A key issue of this review is the broad spectrum of phenomena arising from clusters exposed to strong fields, where the interaction with the laser pulse creates short-lived and dense nanoplasmas. The implications for technical developments include the controlled generation of ion, electron, and radiation pulses, as will be addressed along with corresponding examples. Finally, future prospects of laser-cluster research as well as experimental and theoretical challenges are discussed.},

The atoms reorganize into a completely new structure each time an atom is added when a cluster is very small. However, this cannot go on indefinitely. Eventually, a preferred symmetry becomes frozen into the cluster. Further growth takes place by adding layers of atoms to this frozen core. One layer is sometimes referred to as a geometric shell of atoms. Shell structure is the subject of this article.},

@article{Barnes1986,
	abstract = {Until recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N 2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.},

	abstract = {The Rapid Evaluation of Potential Fields in Particle Systems presents a group of algorithms for the computation of the potential and force fields in large-scale systems of particles that are likely to revolutionize a whole class of computer applications in science and engineering. In many areas of scientific computing, from studying the evolution of galaxies, to simulating the behavior of plasmas and fluids, to modeling chemical systems, a numerical scheme is used to follow the trajectories of a collection of particles moving in accordance with Newton's second law of motion in a field generated by the whole ensemble. Extending the earlier work of Rokhlin, Greengard has developed general, numerically stable methods for evaluating all pairwise interactions in linear time, a great improvement over the quadratic time required by the naive approach, and significantly better than any other proposed alternative. The "Rokhlin-Greengard" algorithm promises to make previously prohibitive simulations feasible, with speedups of three to four orders of magnitude in a system of a million particles. Moreover, the algorithm is well-suited for vector and parallel machines, and should make full use of their capabilities. The author presents his work with great clarity, and demonstrates the superiority of his methods both by mathematical analysis and by the results of numerical experiments.},

The heating mechanism is a consequence of the strongly coupled plasma dynamics, in which collisional processes are strongly modified.

	abstract = {n this paper we report on inner ionization of Xen clusters (n = 55-2171) in ultraintense Gaussian laser fields (peak intensity I = 1015-1020 Wcm-2, pulse width $\tau$ = 25 fs, frequency 0.35 fs-1). The cluster inner ionization process is induced by the barrier suppression ionization (BSI) mechanism and by electron impact ionization (EII), which occurs sequentially with the BSI. We address electron impact ionization of clusters, which pertains to inelastic reactive processes of the high-energy (100 eV 1 keV per electron) nanoplasma. We utilized experimental data for the energy dependence of the electron impact ionization cross-sections of Xej+ (j = 1-10) ions, which were fit by an empirical three-parameter Lotz-type equation, to explore EII in clusters by molecular dynamics simulations. Information was obtained on the yields and time-resolved dynamics of the EII levels (i.e., number nimp of electrons per cluster atom) in the Xen clusters and their dependence on the laser intensity and cluster size. The relative long-time (t = 90 fs) yields for EII, nimp/nii (where nii is the total inner ionization yield) are rather low and increase with decreasing the laser intensity. In the intensity range I = 1015-1016 Wcm-2, nimp/nii = 0.21 for n = 2171 and nimp/nii = 0.09-0.14 for n = 459. while for I = 1018-1020 Wcm-2, nimp/nii = 0.01-0.05. The difference $\Delta$nimp between the EII yield at long time and at tlie termination of the laser pulse reflects on ionization dynamics by the nanoplasma when the laser pulse is switched off. For Xe2171 in the lower intensity domain, $\Delta$nimp = 0.9 at I = 1015 Wcm-2 and $\Delta$nimp = 0.4 at 1016 Wcm-2, reflecting on EII by the persistent nanoplasma under laser free conditions, while in the higher intensity domain of I = 1017-1018 Wcm-2. $\Delta$nimp is negligibly small due to the depletion of the transient nanoplasma.},

The high density of atoms within the cluster greatly enhances the atom-laser interaction, while the finite size of the cluster prevents energy from escaping the interaction region. Recent technological advances have allowed experiments to probe the laser-cluster interaction at very high photon energies, with interactions much stronger than suggested by theories for lower photon energies. We present a model of the laser-cluster interaction that uses nonperturbative R-matrix techniques to calculate inverse bremsstrahlung and photoionization cross sections for Herman-Skillman atomic potentials. We describe the evolution of the cluster under the influence of the processes of inverse bremsstrahlung heating, photoionization, collisional ionization and recombination, and expansion of the cluster. We compare total energy absorbed with the Hamburg experiment of Wabnitz et al. [Nature 420, 482 (2002)] and ejected electron spectra with Laarmann et al.},

	abstract = {Fast electrons emitted from xenon clusters in strong femtosecond 90 eV pulses have been measured at the Free-electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH). Energy absorption occurs mainly through atomic inner-shell photo-ionization. Photo-electrons are trapped in the strong Coulomb potential of the cluster ions and form a non-equilibrium plasma with supra-atomic density. Its equilibration through multiple energy-exchanging collisions within the entire cluster volume produces electrons with energies well beyond the dominant emission line of atomic xenon. Here, in contrast to traditional low-frequency laser plasma heating, the plasma gains energy from electrons delivered through massive single-photon excitation from bound states. Electron emission induced by thermalization of a non-equilibrium plasma is expected to be a general phenomenon occurring for strong atomic x-ray absorption in extended systems.},

	abstract = {Intense radiation from lasers has opened up many new areas of research in physics and chemistry, and has revolutionized optical technology. So far, most work in the field of nonlinear processes has been restricted to infrared, visible and ultraviolet light, although progress in the development of X-ray lasers has been made recently. With the advent of a free-electron laser in the soft-X-ray regime below 100 nm wavelength, a new light source is now available for experiments with intense, short-wavelength radiation that could be used to obtain deeper insights into the structure of matter. Other free-electron sources with even shorter wavelengths are planned for the future. Here we present initial results from a study of the interaction of soft X-ray radiation, generated by a free-electron laser, with Xe atoms and clusters. We find that, whereas Xe atoms become only singly ionized by the absorption of single photons, absorption in clusters is strongly enhanced. On average, each atom in large clusters absorbs up to 400 eV, corresponding to 30 photons. We suggest that the clusters are heated up and electrons are emitted after acquiring sufficient energy. The clusters finally disintegrate completely by Coulomb explosion.},

In the case of xenon, the degree of nonlinear photoionization was found to be significantly higher than for neon, argon, and krypton.

The LCLS has set a new standard, with a peak X-ray brightness higher by ten orders of magnitudes and pulse duration shorter by three orders of magnitudes. LCLS opens a new window in the exploration of matter at the atomic and molecular scales of length and time. Taking a motion picture of chemical processes in a few femtoseconds or less, unraveling the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, like proteins, are some of the exciting experiments made possible by LCLS and the other X-ray FELs now being built in Europe and Asia. In this paper, we describe the history of the many theoretical, experimental and technological discoveries and innovations, starting from the 1960s and 1970s, leading to the development of LCLS.},

Using high harmonic generation from a 35 fs laser, clusters have been irradiated by extreme ultraviolet pulses at intensity approaching 1011 W/cm2. Charge states up to Xe8+ are observed, states well above those produced by single atom illumination, indicating that plasma continuum lowering is important. Furthermore, the kinetic energy distribution of the exploding ions is consistent with a quasineutral hydrodynamic expansion, rather than a Coulomb explosion.},

	abstract = {The expansion and disintegration dynamics of xenon clusters initiated by the ionization with femtosecond soft x-ray extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses were studied with pump--probe spectroscopy using the autocorrelator setup of the Free-Electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) facility. The ionization by the first XUV pulse of 92 eV photon energy (8 × 10\^{}12 W cm\^{}-2) leads to the generation of a large number of quasi-free electrons trapped by the space charge of the cluster ions. A temporally delayed, more intense probe (4 × 10\^{}13 W cm\^{}-2) pulse substantially increases a population of nanoplasma electrons providing a way of probing plasma states in the expanding cluster by tracing the average charge of fragment ions. The results of the study reveal a timescale for cluster expansion and disintegration, which depends essentially on the initial cluster size. The average charge state of fragment ions, and thus the cluster plasma changes significantly on a timescale of 1--3 ps.},

	abstract = {We investigate the wavelength-dependent ionization, heating, and expansion dynamics of medium-sized rare-gas clusters (Ar 923 ) under intense femtosecond short-wavelength free-electron laser pulses by quasi-classical molecular dynamics simulations. A comparison of the interaction dynamics for pulses with hbar omega=20, 38 and 90 eV photon energy at fixed total excitation energy indicates a smooth transition from plasma-driven cluster expansion, where predominantly surface ions are expelled by hydrodynamic forces, to quasi-electrostatic behavior with almost pure Coulomb explosion. Corresponding signatures in the time-dependent cluster dynamics, as well as in the final ion and electron spectra, corroborate that this transition is linked to a crossover in the electron emission processes. The resulting signatures in the electron spectra are shown to be even more reliable for identifying the cluster expansion mechanisms than ion energy spectra. It is shown that the prevailing ionization mechanism and the dominant expansion process can be roughly estimated by a simple frustration parameter.},

@article{Ziaja2009b,
	abstract = {Kinetic Boltzmann equations are used to describe electron emission spectra obtained after irradiation of noble-gas clusters with intense vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation from a free-electron-laser (FEL). The experimental photoelectron spectra give a complementary and more detailed view of nonlinear processes within atoms and clusters in an intense laser field compared to mass spectroscopy data. Results from our model obtained in this study confirm the experimental and theoretical findings on the differing ionization scenarios at longer (100 nm) and shorter (32 nm) VUV radiation wavelengths. At the wavelength of 100 nm the thermoelectronic electron emission dominates the emission spectra. This indicates the plasma formation and the inverse bremsstrahlung (IB) heating of electrons inside the plasma. This effect is clearly visible for xenon (with the fitted temperature of 6-7 eV), and less visible for argon (with the fitted temperature of 2-3 eV). The two-photon-ionization rate for argon that initiates the cluster ionization, is much lower than the single-photoionization rate for xenon. Also, more of the photoelectrons created within an argon cluster are able to leave it, as they are more energetic than those released from a xenon cluster. Therefore, the IB heating of plasma electrons in argon is less efficient than in xenon, as the density of the electrons remaining within the cluster is lower.},
