abstract = {The impact of atomic excited states is investigated via a detailed model of laser-cluster interactions, which is applied to rare gas clusters in intense femtosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV). This demonstrates the potential for a two-step ionization process in laser-cluster interactions, with the resulting intermediate excited states allowing for the creation of high charge states and the rapid dissemination of laser pulse energy. The consequences of this excitation mechanism are demonstrated through simulations of recent experiments in argon clusters interacting with XUV radiation, in which this two-step process is shown to play a primary role; this is consistent with our hypothesis that XUV-cluster interactions provide a unique window into the role of excited atomic states due to the relative lack of photoionization and laser field-driven phenomena. Our analysis suggests that atomic excited states may play an important role in interactions of intense radiation with materials in a 
variety of wavelength regimes, including potential implications for proposed studies of single molecule imaging with intense X-rays.},

abstract = {We examine the effect of cluster size on the interaction of Ar55-Ar2057 with intense extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses, using a model we developed earlier that includes ionization via collisional excitation as an intermediate step. We find that the dynamics of these irradiated clusters is dominated by collisions. Larger clusters are more highly collisional, produce higher charge states, and do so more rapidly than smaller clusters. Higher charge states produced via collisions are found to reduce the overall photon absorption, since charge states of Ar2+ and higher are no longer photoaccessible. We call this mechanism collisionally reduced photoabsorption, and it decreases the effective cluster photoabsorption cross section by more than 30\% for Ar55 and 45\% for Ar2057. The time evolution of the electron kinetic energy distribution begins as a (mostly) Maxwellian distribution. Further, the electron velocity distribution of large clusters quickly become isotropic while smaller clusters retain the 
inherent anisotropy created by photoionization. Last, the total electron kinetic-energy distribution is integrated over the spatial profile of the laser and the log-normal distribution of cluster size for comparison with a recent experiment [C. Bostedt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 133401 (2008)], and good agreement is found.},

@article{Bigaouette2011,
abstract = {We developed a straightforward yet effective method of increasing the accuracy of grid-based partial differential equation (PDE) solvers by condensing computational grid points near centers of interest. We applied this ?nonlinear mapping? of grid points to a finite-differenced explicit implementation of a time dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation solver in three dimensions. A particular multi-center mapping was developed for systems with multiple Coulomb potentials, allowing the solver to be used in complex configurations where symmetry cannot be used for simplification. We verified our method by finding the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the Hydrogen atom and the Hydrogen molecular ion (View the MathML source) and comparing them to known solutions. We demonstrated that our nonlinear mapping scheme ? which can be readily added to existing PDE solvers ? results in a marked increase in accuracy versus a linear mapping with the same number of (or even much fewer) grid points, thus reducing memory 
and computational requirements by orders of magnitude.},
