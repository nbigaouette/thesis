\subsection{Author contributions}
The MD package was mostly written by N. B. The post processing scripts used to
analyze data and generate figures were entirely written by N. B. Generated
figures were then tweaked by E. A. for inclusion. Cross-sections for ACI were
calculated by E. A. who wrote a large part of the article text. All authors
contributed to the discussion.
