\GenericNonNumberedSection{Statement of Originality}{
I hereby certify that the work of the present thesis, to the best of my
knowledge, is original and my own. All codes used for the numerical studies
and their analysis were written by me, except some contributions from Edward
Ackad (a postdoctoral fellow in the group for two years) who contributed (in
terms of lines of code) around 15~\% of the MD package and 20~\% of the
ionization library. Transitions cross-sections (ground to excited
states and excited states to continuum) used in the ACI model were obtained by
him using the Cowan code, the only external package used throughout this work.
A smaller contribution was done by two summer students, Julien Roy and
Stan Hatko, who helped in some technical aspect of the code development.
My huge work on the simulation packages allowed Edward Ackad to generate generous
amount of data that was used for the publications; he still uses it today after
departing Ottawa for an Assistant Professor position at Southern Illinois
University at Edwardsville.
