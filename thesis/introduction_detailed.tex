\section{Laser-Cluster interaction}

\subsection{Clusters}
Clusters of atoms have been in use for a longer time than we might normally
think. For example, gold clusters were used in ancient Rome for their optical
properties where their size could be controlled to produce different glass colours.
Gustav Mie was the first to theoretically describe the interaction of light
with (gold) ``spheres'' in 1908, explaining the cluster size dependence of the
light absorption. During the last part of the twentieth century, the discovery of
C$_{60}$ fullerenes marked the real beginning of cluster studies.

As the Roman saw, the size of clusters is a key property. Techniques to fully
control the size of produced clusters allowed a wide range of studies and
applications. The advance of high-power and short duration lasers opened the
door for further interesting ultra-fast studies. With femtosecond
(1 fs = 10$^{-15}$ s) lasers it became possible to study electron motion,
similarly to a camera flash that captures a moving scene. Many femtosecond lasers
have a wavelength of 800 nm in the infrared (IR) and cluster have been studied
thoroughly with this ``long'' wavelength. Investigation of energetic
electrons (keV) or highly charged ions (MeV) emission, X-rays production or even
table-top neutron sources were performed since the 1990s\cite{Haberland1994,Brabec2009}.

Clusters are invaluable tools because they bridge the gap between single atoms
and solids. Their high density allows them to exhibit collective effects similarly
to bulk materials while their small icosahedral\cite{Martin1996} size increases
their surface to volume ratio.
At the smallest range, clusters can be used as models for small molecules and
at the opposite they still present interesting optical properties at 10,000
atoms\cite{Reinhard2004}.

Additionally to their great size scalability, clusters explosion by-products
after interaction with a strong laser field are accessible, revealing detailed
information about the dynamics. For example, time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometry can reveal the ions charge state spectrum which reveals the amount
of energy absorbed from the laser pulse. This kind of data is not accessible
in the case of laser-bulk interaction since the majority of matter stays on the
solid.

The most important characteristic of laser-cluster interaction for the present
work is the fact that clusters can be studied numerically. Full quantum resolution
is not possible even for clusters consisting of a couple of atoms, while on the
other range of the methods spectrum rates equations and (nano)plasma models are
too macroscopic to reflect the large fields gradient present during cluster
dynamics\cite{Fennel2010}. The tool of choice for this problem is Molecular Dynamics
(MD) where dynamics are treated classically; Newton's equations of motion are
solved at each time steps and quantum effects are included using specific rates.

For these reasons, clusters are invaluable tools to study light and matter
interaction. This can be seen by the vast amount of work on the subject, mainly
in the IR regime\cite{Fennel2010}. However, in recent years, laser light sources
have been moving to shorter wavelengths due to new Free Electron Lasers (FEL)
facilities; Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV), Extreme Ultra-Violet (XUV), soft X-Rays
and even hard X-rays are now accessible. In FELs, relativistic electrons are sent
through an ondulator in which they emit a coherent pulse, tunable in wavelength
(by changing the electrons initial energy)
from microwaves to X-rays\cite{Brabec2009,Ackermann2007a,Pellegrini2012} at unprecedented
intensities. A single 10 to 100 fs FEL pulse can contain 10$^{13}$ photons, the
same amount produced by the bests synchrotrons during \textit{one second}\cite{Bostedt2009}.

At shorter wavelengths, the laser field becomes less important than in the IR
regime. The Keldysh parameter $\gamma$ dictates which processes are dominant. In
cases where $\gamma \ll 1$ the electric field of the laser is strong enough that
electrons can tunnel out of their parent ion during a single laser cycle.
However, when $\gamma \gg 1$ the laser frequency is too large compared to the
field's strength and photon processes dominates. Experiments in 2002 at
DESY's FLASH (\textbf{F}ree-electron-\textbf{Las}er in \textbf{H}amburg)\cite{Bostedt2009}
on Xenon clusters in the VUV regime had $\gamma$ values between 8 and
100\cite{Wabnitz2002} putting it in the regime dominated by photon processes.
During these experiments, unexpected high charge states were seen that could not
be explained by traditional energy transfer mechanisms. Theoretical work was
then performed for explaining these high charge states, processes that will be
covered in section \ref{section:intro:clusters:heating}. At shorter wavelength,
Argon clusters were studied in the XUV regime\cite{Bostedt2008}. The 32.8 nm
wavelength (32.8 eV photon energy) is 5 eV above Argon's first ionization
potential. It was found that ionization is a multistep process of
photo-electrons emission and because of the subsequent charge buildup in the
cluster, the electron energy distribution is non-thermal. More multiphoton
ionization experiments on Nitrogen, Argon, Neon and Helium were performed at
FLASH.

At the even shorter wavelength of 13.7 nm, Xenon clusters irradiated at
$\ten{7.5}{15}$~W/cm$^2$ produced charged states of up to 21+\cite{Sorokin2007,Richter2009},
meaning 60 XUV (93 eV) photons had to be absorbed per atom. Xenon's giant 4d
resonance is though to be the cause of these high charge states seen by is still
debated.

\subsection{Energy Absorption Mechanisms}
\label{section:intro:clusters:heating}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Missing recombination
\end{itemize}

Interaction of light with single atoms is a well understood problem but the
collective effects of the high density of atoms in a cluster gives rise to many
different mechanisms of energy absorption and redistribution throughout the
cluster. The following will go over the different mechanisms. While the
mechanisms are highly dependent on the regime (cluster material and
laser wavelength combination), I will concentrate on the VUV and XUV
regime mostly.


\subsubsection{Single Photon Ionization}
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cite: Wabnitz2002, Young2010, Bosted2010, Murphy2008
\end{itemize}

The first energy absorption mechanisms is single photon ionization. Initially
described by Einstein as the photoelectric effect, a bound electron
absorbs a photon from the laser and is promoted to the continuum where it is
free to leave its parent ion. Figure~\ref{fig:ionization:single} describes
shows the a schematic of the mechanism. For the process to be present, the
photon energy
needs to be at least the binding energy of the electron. In the case of
atomic Xenon, the first energy level is at -12.3 eV which requires a photon
of a wavelength equal or shorter than 100.8 nm. These wavelengths are normally
called \textit{vacuum ultra-violet} (VUV) or \textit{extreme
ultra-violet} (XUV).

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.38\columnwidth]{figures/mockups/ionization_single}
 \caption{Single photon ionization}
 \label{fig:ionization:single}
\end{figure}


The photon's extra energy will be transferred as kinetic energy in the
resulting photoelectron. This can thus be used to sample the states in the
target by measuring the photoelectron energy spectrum\cite{Fennel2010}.

Implementing single photon ionization in the model is done through a
transition rate which is itself obtained from a cross-section. Because
cross-sections can be obtained from experiments for any kind of target, it is
easily integrated into the model.

The rate of single photon ionization $\Gamma$ is obtained using the laser
pulse intensity profile $I\pa{t}$ and cross-section $\sigma$:
\begin{align}
\Gamma & = I\pa{t} \sigma\pa{\omega}
\end{align}
For the present work, Xenon experimental cross-sections $\sigma\pa{\omega}$
were obtained from reference \cite{West1978} and from reference
\cite{Marr1976} for Argon.

Once the rate $\Gamma$ is calculated, it is weighted\cite{Lax2006} by the time
step size and compared to a random number $r$:
\begin{align}
1 - \e{-\Gamma \Delta t} > r
\end{align}
When the previous test succeeds, ionization takes place and a new electron is
created in the code with its kinetic energy set as the difference between the
ionization potential and the photon energy. Then, the intensity profile of the
laser $I\pa{t}$ is decreased by one photon for better description of low fluence
pulses.





\subsubsection{Impact Ionization}
Impact ionization is also be described in terms of cross-sections. These
cross-sections are normally obtained from the semi-empirical Lotz
formula\cite{Lotz1967}:
\begin{align}
\sigma & = \sum_{i}^{N} a_i q_i \frac{\ln{\pa{E/P_i}}}{E P_i} \pa{1 - b_i
\ex{-c_i \pa{E/P_i - 1}}}
\label{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz}
\end{align}
where $P_i$ is the ionization potential of the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ shell and $E$
the impacting electron's kinetic energy \textit{at infinity}.
Data for Xenon was obtained from reference \cite{Tawara1987} for neutrals
% Figure 254, page 317
and reference \cite{Heidenreich2005} for charged states.
% Parameters were taken from figure 1 (a), (b) and (c)
% Note that parameters from figure 1 (a) and (b) for
% the 4+ and 5+ do not give satisfactory results. They were
% obtained by fitting the data directly from the figures

Special care needs to be taken with equation \eqref{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz}
as it was obtained for electrons coming ``from infinity''. In the case of
clusters, electrons are not coming from an infinite distance. We thus need to
extrapolate the kinetic energy of the electron as if it was coming from
infinity. For this, when impact ionization is tested on an electron, its
potential energy with respect to the impacted ion is removed from the kinetic
energy. This effectively gets an energy far from the ion. The cluster
environment is taken into account by considering the potential from the cluster
at the impacted ion as the threshold under which the bound electron lies.
Figure \ref{fig:ionization:impact} shows the energy diagram used during the
process.

 \caption{Impact ionization}
 \label{fig:ionization:impact}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Tunnel Ionization}
Laser mater interaction cannot be studied without at least mentioning
\textit{tunnel} or \textit{field ionization}. For sufficiently strong laser
fields and long wavelengths, the Coulomb potential of an atom can be bent enough
that the probability of a bound electron tunnelling out becomes significant, as
shown on figure \ref{fig:ionization:tunnel}.

% \emptyfig{Tunnel ionization}{fig:ionization:tunnel}
\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.76\columnwidth]{figures/mockups/ionization_tunnel}
 \caption{Tunnel ionization}
 \label{fig:ionization:tunnel}
\end{figure}

The Keldysh adiabatic parameter $\gamma$ separates two regimes\cite{Fennel2010}.
On one side tunnel ionization is dominant and $\gamma \ll 1$, while single
photon ionization dominates when $\gamma~\gg~1$. The regime of interest in the
current work has $\gamma \gg 1$ and as such, tunnel ionization is not
considered.


\subsubsection{Inverse Bremsstrahlung}
Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating (IBH) is the inverse process of Bremsstrahlung
where an electron emits a photon when deflected, either by a heavier ion in the
case of plasma or by magnetic fields in the case of synchrotrons. IBH plays an
important role in the IR regime\cite{Fennel2010} where the laser field easily
drives the electrons through the cluster. This linear momentum is redistributed
as thermal energy by collisions and scattering on heavier ions. While not as
strong as in the IR regime, IBH is still important in the VUV\cite{Krainov2000}
up to 62 nm\cite{Georgescu2007}.




\subsubsection{Other mechanisms}
Other mechanisms were proposed in lights of results from recent experiments at
FEL installations\cite{Wabnitz2002}. Because the previous mechanisms cannot
explain by themselves
the results, many different groups proposed extra mechanisms.


First, Santra \& Greene proposed using \textit{atomic potentials} instead of
the Coulomb potential in a rate equation model (with infinite spacial
extension and
constant density). This potential shape represents a shielding potential: when
entering the ion vicinity, an electron begins to see an unshielded ionic core.
In reference \cite{Greene2003}, they used an analytic form, fitting one
parameter
with the first ionization potential. Later\cite{Walters2006}, they used a
potential shape generated by the code written by Herman and
Skillman\cite{HS1963} (HS) to describe a more valid potential, based on a
Hartree-Fock formulation. Using these atomic potentials, they saw Xe$^{3+}$,
Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.4}{12}$, $\ten{1.4}{13}$ and
$\ten{7.3}{13}$ W/cm$^2$ respectively for Xe$_{1,500}$ clusters, similarly to
what was seen in at FEL-DESY.

Another model proposed by Siedschlag and Rost\cite{Siedschlag2004} in 2004 was
the barrier suppression in single photon absorption. Due to the close proximity
of neighbours, the potential barrier between them is lowered and
a photo-transition to the continuum becomes possible, even with a single photon.

\textit{Many-Body Recombination} (MBR) was proposed in 2005
as a simple mechanism to explain the high charge states seen in VUV
experiments at FEL-DESY\cite{Jungreuthmayer2005}. In a strongly coupled plasma
generated by a VUV pulse, electrons can recombine easily to a high excited
state after collisions with many bodies. Later, these newly bound electrons can
absorb a new photon from the laser field for another transition to the
continuum. Because MBR is much more efficient than three-body
recombination (due to the large density of charged particles), much more
photons are absorbs this way. The simplicity of the
method lies in the fact that in a classical MD simulation, MBR is automatically
included without extra implementation. Jungreuthmayer \textit{et al.} were able
to see Xe$^{3+}$, Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.5}{12}$,
$\ten{1.5}{13}$ and $\ten{7}{13}$ W/cm$^2$ respectively when simulating
Xe$_{1,000}$ clusters.


\subsubsubsection{Augmented Collisional Ionization}
The previous models are without doubt interesting, but they were developed with
the goal of describing Wabnitz's 2002 experiments at FLASH-DESY. In 2010, Bosted
re-calibrated the intensity used during the 2002 experiments.
Instead of the previously though $\ten{2}{13}$ W/cm$^2$, the power density was
re-calibrated to $\ten{8}{12}$ W/cm$^2$, less than half of the initial value.
Could the different models still produce the same amount of high charge states
seen at the lower intensities?

Our group proposed another mechanism for energy transfer from the laser field
to the cluster. With this two-steps model, an electron might not have enough
kinetic energy to ionize an atom (or ion), but it could still transfer some of
its energy to promote a bound electron to an excited state. Once an atom is
excited, it becomes easier to ionize, due to the large cross-sections of excited
atoms and ions, by subsequent impact from a low energy electron. This gives the
opportunity for low energy electrons to still participate in the cluster
ionization, giving the name \textit{augmented collisional ionization} (ACI) to
the process.

Figure \ref{fig:ionization:aci} shows an energy diagram of ACI and the
different transitions possible.

          $K_2$ necessary for the transition to continuum.}
 \label{fig:ionization:aci}
\end{figure}

More details on ACI are given in section \ref{section:papers:aci} along with
results on Argon clusters. Section \ref{section:papers:size} studies the cluster
size influence when ACI is used in the XUV regime. In section
\ref{section:papers:100nm} ACI is applied to the VUV regime and the
2002 experiments at FLASH-DESY.




\subsection{Goals}

In view of the previous section, the goal of the current thesis is to increase
to global knowledge of laser-matter interaction. More specifically, the
question of \textit{how} the energy is deposited in a nanoscale object by an
ultra-short and ultra-intense laser pulse will be studied. This interaction
largely depends on the specific target material and on the pulse's wavelength
and duration, both making up the interaction regime. A specific regime will
thus be targeted; mainly short wavelengths, from VUV to XUV, as many questions
raising from recent experiments are still debated.

While many tools exist to study laser-mater interaction, it was decided to use
a classical approach since it allows for relatively large systems to be
simulated. Large field fluctuations are also best described with
classical approaches\cite{Fennel2010}.

\subsection{Thesis Outline}
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Don't forget a review/description of each sections of the thesis.
\item Include a subsection with each of my contributions from each paper.
\end{itemize}

This thesis is presented as a series of published or almost published articles.
First, section \ref{section:tools} describes the different tools and models
that were developed and implemented for the current work. While section
\ref{section:tools:md} concentrate on the classical aspect of the problem,
section \ref{section:tools:qfdtd} deals with a quantum approach that was
used. Note that all implementations used are original work; all code packages
were developed and written by me, with a few exceptions on the ACI
cross-sections calculations and post-processing scripts.

Section \ref{section:papers:aci} presents the article ``Augmented collisional
ionization via excited states in XUV cluster interactions'' published in 2011
in \textit{Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics}. This
was the first article on the topic and looked at the influence of ACI with Argon
clusters.

Second, section \ref{section:papers:size} presents the article ``Clusters in
intense XUV pulses: Effects of cluster size on expansion dynamics and
ionization''. Also published in 2011 (\textit{Physical Review A)}, Argon
clusters were simulated in the XUV regime and many cluster parameters were
studied.

Later in section \ref{section:papers:qfdtd} the article ``Nonlinear grid mapping
applied to an FDTD-based, multi-center 3D Schr\"odinger equation solver'' is
presented. Published in 2012 in \textit{Computer Physics Communications}, it
explains the QFDTD method and its implementation, with emphasis on the new
nonlinear mapping introduced for faster calculation.

Finally, section \ref{section:papers:100nm} contains the draft of the article
(\textbf{FIXME}) ``Revisiting the 100nm experiment with ACI''. In it, ACI is
applied to the VUV regime and Xenon clusters, with similar parameters as the 2002
FEL experiment. This is an important step as the previous theoretical works
used to explain the experiment's results used an intensity that was
recalibrated in 2010. We show in the article that ACI can explain the high
charge states seen in experiments, even at the lower intensity.

Additionally, section \ref{section:other} specifies other, non-published,
contributions that were made during the years. The reader will find, in appendix
\ref{appendix:code}, an overview of the usage of the different simulation
packages and libraries developed.
