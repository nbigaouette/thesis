% \subsection{Detailed Introduction}
% Describe in more details the work done: The physics, the models. The specific
% litterature search goes here.

The previous section described the general goals of this thesis and was used to
give the reader an overview picture of the field. The following will go
into more details.

NOTES:
\begin{itemize}
\item Current work motivated by recent FEL experiments at specific regime.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Goals}
In view of the previous section, the goal of the current thesis is to increase
to global knowledge of laser-matter interaction. More specifically, the
question of \textit{how} the energy is deposited in a nanoscale object by an
ultra-short and ultra-intense laser pulse is important.

\subsection{Laser-Cluster interaction}
\cite{Reinhard2004}


\subsubsection{Clusters}
\label{section:intro:clusters:clusters}

Clusters of atoms are an extremely useful tool to study laser-matter
interaction. They are experimentally easy to produce since many
years\cite{Haberland1994}. Their size and constitution can be varied almost at
will \cite{Martin1996}.

\cite{Fennel2010}

\subsubsection{Energy Absorption Mechanisms}
\label{section:intro:clusters:heating}
FIXME: Rename ``heating'' to something else.

Specify that the different mechanisms depends on the regime (material and
wavelength).

Don't talk about tunnel ionization. Just mention it, maybe one paragraph (not
one page). Giving Keldysh parameter, we are most interested in another regime.


\subsubsubsection{Single Photon Ionization}
The first energy absorption mechanisms is single photon ionization. Initially
described described by Einstein as the photoelectric effect, a bound electron
absorbs a photon from the laser and is promoted to the continuum where it is
free to leave its parent ion. Figure \ref{fig:ionization:single} describes
shows the mechanism in detail. For the process to be present, the photon energy
needs to be at least the binding energy of the electron. In the case of
atomic Xenon, the first energy level is at -12.3 eV which requires a photon
of a wavelength equal or shorter than 100.8 nm. These wavelength are normally
called \textit{vacuum ultra-violet} (VUV) and also \textit{extreme
ultra-violet} (XUV).

\subsubsubsection{Impact Ionization}
\subsubsubsection{Tunnel Ionization}
Laser mater interaction cannot be studied without at least mentioning
\textit{tunnel} or \textit{field ionization}.
