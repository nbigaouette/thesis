The previous section described the general goals of this thesis and was used to
give the reader an overview picture of the field. The following will go
into more details.

\subsection{Goals}
In view of the previous section, the goal of the current thesis is to increase
to global knowledge of laser-matter interaction. More specifically, the
question of \textit{how} the energy is deposited in a nanoscale object by an
ultra-short and ultra-intense laser pulse is important.

\subsection{Laser-Cluster interaction}


\subsubsection{Clusters}
\label{section:intro:clusters:clusters}

Clusters of atoms are an extremely useful tool to study laser-matter
interaction. They are experimentally easy to produce since many
years\cite{Haberland1994}. Their size and constitution can be varied almost at
will \cite{Martin1996}.
