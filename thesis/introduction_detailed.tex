\section{Laser-Cluster interaction}

\subsection{Clusters of atoms and strong laser fields}
Clusters of atoms have been in use for a longer time than we might normally
think. For example, gold clusters were used in ancient Rome for their optical
properties where their size could be controlled to produce different glass colours.
Gustav Mie was the first to theoretically describe the interaction of light
with (gold) ``spheres'' in 1908, explaining the cluster size dependence of the
light absorption. During the last part of the twentieth century, the discovery of
C$_{60}$ fullerenes marked the real beginning of cluster studies.

As the Roman saw, the size of clusters is a key property. Techniques to fully
control the size of produced clusters allowed a wide range of studies and
applications. The advance of high-power and short duration lasers opened the
door for further interesting ultra-fast studies. With femtosecond
(1 fs = 10$^{-15}$ s) lasers it became possible to study electron motion,
similarly to a camera flash that captures a moving scene. Many femtosecond lasers
have a wavelength of 800 nm in the infrared (IR) and cluster have been studied
thoroughly with this ``long'' wavelength. Investigation of energetic
electrons (keV) or highly charged ions (MeV) emission, X-rays production or even
table-top neutron sources were performed since the 1990s\cite{Haberland1994,Brabec2009}.

Clusters are invaluable tools because they bridge the gap between single atoms
and solids. Their high density allows them to exhibit collective effects similarly
to bulk materials while their small icosahedral\cite{Martin1996} size increases
their surface to volume ratio.
At the smallest range, clusters can be used as models for small molecules and
at the opposite they still present interesting optical properties at 10,000
atoms\cite{Reinhard2004}.

Additionally to their great size scalability, clusters explosion by-products
after interaction with a strong laser field are accessible, revealing detailed
information about the dynamics. For example, time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometry can reveal the ions charge state spectrum which reveals the amount
of energy absorbed from the laser pulse. This kind of data is not accessible
in the case of laser-bulk interaction since the majority of matter stays on the
solid.

The most important characteristic of laser-cluster interaction for the present
work is the fact that clusters can be studied numerically. Full quantum resolution
is not possible even for clusters consisting of a couple of atoms, while on the
other range of the methods spectrum rates equations and (nano)plasma models are
too macroscopic to reflect the large fields gradient present during cluster
dynamics\cite{Fennel2010}. The tool of choice for this problem is Molecular Dynamics
(MD) where dynamics are treated classically; Newton's equations of motion are
solved at each time steps and quantum effects are included using specific rates.

For these reasons, clusters are invaluable tools to study light and matter
interaction. This can be seen by the vast amount of work on the subject, mainly
in the IR regime\cite{Fennel2010}. Varin \textit{et al.}\cite{Varin2012} recently
developed a particle-in-cell (PIC) code with microscopic corrections that takes
into consideration the electromagnetic field propagation throughout a pre-ionized
cluster. Going from electrostatic to electrodynamic allows simulating clusters
of significant size where fields propagation must be correctly resolved. The
microscopic corrections allows the close range interactions between
charged particles to be of high precision compared to traditional PIC
codes\cite{Peltz2012}. Since the grid must resolve the electromagnetic wave,
PIC simulations can thus be a challenge when the wavelength is small but this
opens the door to a new frontier of modelling.

The IR regime sparked a new field of ultrafast physics. By stripping electrons
from their parent ion through tunnel ionization and accelerating them in the
strong electric field, train of pulses of high harmonics can be generated (HHG).
Taking place during a single femtosecond pulse, this train of smaller pulses
can reach the attosecond (10$^{-18}$ s) duration, an exciting developing field.

Moreover, in recent years, laser light sources
have been moving to shorter wavelengths due to new Free Electron Lasers (FEL)
facilities; Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV), Extreme Ultra-Violet (XUV), soft X-Rays
and even hard X-rays are now accessible. In FELs, relativistic electrons are sent
through an ondulator in which they emit a coherent pulse, tunable in wavelength
(by changing the electrons initial energy)
from microwaves to X-rays\cite{Brabec2009,Ackermann2007a,Pellegrini2012} at
unprecedented intensities. A single 10 to 100 fs FEL pulse can contain 10$^{13}$
photons, the same amount produced by the bests synchrotrons during
\textit{one second}\cite{Bostedt2009}.

At shorter wavelengths, the laser field becomes less important than in the IR
regime. The Keldysh parameter $\gamma$ dictates which processes are dominant. In
cases where $\gamma \ll 1$ the electric field of the laser is strong enough that
electrons can tunnel out of their parent ion during a single laser cycle.
However, when $\gamma \gg 1$ the laser frequency is too large compared to the
field's strength and photon processes dominates. Experiments in 2002\cite{Wabnitz2002} at
DESY's FLASH (\textbf{F}ree-electron-\textbf{Las}er in \textbf{H}amburg)\cite{Bostedt2009}
on Xenon clusters in the VUV regime had $\gamma$ values between 8 and
100 putting it in the regime dominated by photon processes.
During these experiments, unexpected high charge states were seen that could not
be explained by traditional energy transfer mechanisms. Theoretical work was
then performed for explaining these high charge states, processes that will be
covered in section \ref{section:intro:mechanisms}.
In 2006, a proof-of-principle experiment showed that that it is possible to
do (soft) X-rays diffraction imaging using FLASH pulses\cite{Chapman2006}.
Similar studies on Xenon clusters were performed in 2010\cite{Bostedt2010}.

At shorter wavelength,
Argon clusters were studied in the XUV regime\cite{Bostedt2008}. The 32.8 nm
wavelength (32.8 eV photon energy) is 5 eV above Argon's first ionization
potential. It was found that ionization is a multistep process of
photo-electrons emission and because of the subsequent charge buildup in the
cluster, the electron energy distribution is non-thermal. More multiphoton
ionization experiments on Nitrogen, Argon, Neon and Helium were performed at
FLASH.

At the even shorter wavelength of 13.7 nm, Xenon clusters irradiated at
$\ten{7.5}{15}$~W/cm$^2$ produced charged states of up to 21+\cite{Sorokin2007,Richter2009},
meaning 60 XUV (93 eV) photons had to be absorbed per atom. Xenon's giant 4d
resonance is though to be the cause of these high charge states seen by is still
debated.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC, Stanford, is another important
FEL facility where the first FEL hard X-rays lasing was performed in
\cite{Emma2010,Schneider2010}. Single Neon atoms were studied in
this hard X-rays source\cite{Young2010} showing fully stripped neon nucleus.
Later in 2011, protein nanocrystallography was performed \cite{Chapman2011}
on photosystem I, a large cell membrane protein. By using pulses shorter
than the explosion time scale, the protein's structure could be reconstructed,
opening the door for the determination of the structure of biomolecules that
do not crystallize correctly for use in traditional crystallography studies.
In the same Nature issue, Mimivirus, the second largest known virus at 450 nm
of diameter, was imaged using single shot hard X-ray pulse (0.69~nm,
1.8~keV)\cite{Seibert2011}. LCLS pulses have a duration of 70 to 500 fs at
wavelengths of 0.15 nm to 2.2 nm\cite{Pellegrini2011}.

Cluster studies continue to this day in regimes such as VUV\cite{Arbeiter2011},
XUV\cite{Murphy2008a,Murphy2008b,Krikunova2012} and X-rays\cite{Ziaja2009b}.




\subsection{Motivation: Microscopic mechanisms underlying the dynamics}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms}
Interaction of light with single rare gas atoms is a well studied problem but
the collective effects of the high density of atoms in a cluster gives rise to
many different mechanisms of energy absorption and redistribution throughout the
cluster. The following will go over the different mechanisms by going over the
different wavelength regimes, from the long wavelength (IR) to the shorter XUV.

The different mechanisms described in this section can be sorted into two main
families. First, the direct mechanisms are the simplest as they are the result
of the interaction between atoms with the laser field. They can normally be
described using isolated atoms. For example, single-photon ionization where one
photon is absorbed by a bound electron and gets promoted to the continuum is
a direct interaction between the laser and the atom.

The second family consist of indirect mechanisms where the cluster environment
is vital for the process to take place. These indirect mechanisms don't
necessarily transfer energy from the laser to the cluster but are still an
important aspect of cluster dynamics. For example, impact ionization where
an electron hits an atom and promotes a bound electron to the continuum by
sharing some of its kinetic energy is independent on the presence of a laser
(but obviously still requires free electrons). As will be describe later,
indirect mechanisms are still important for the cluster dynamics and can also
help energy transfer from the laser to the cluster.

The different mechanisms will be brought from the different wavelength regimes
they appear or are dominant, by going from infrared (IR) down to X-rays. Figure
\ref{fig:regimes} shows the different regimes in terms of wavelengths and also
intensities. Most studies on clusters are performed on femtosecond IR laser
pulses which span a large range of intensity. These kind of lasers are
widespread and dominated by Ti:sapphire pumped with another laser. The pump
laser (Nd:YAG) lases at 1064 nm and is frequency-doubled to 534 nm in a
nonlinear crystal. The Ti:sapphire then emits 800 nm light with a wide range of
intensity.

The advance of Free-Electron Lasers (FEL) allowed high intensity of VUV, XUV and
even X-rays laser source. As described previously, FEL require large facilities,
mainly due to the linear particle accelerator required to seed the ondulator
with relativistic electrons and as such are scarce and their intensity is limited
compared to Ti:sapphire lasers. Nevertheless, as will be shown later on, their
tunable wavelength allows them to access different interesting regimes.

The Keldysh adiabatic parameter $\gamma$ separates regimes where processes are
dominated by either photons or field and reads
\begin{align}
% http://www.iuac.res.in/atmol/~safvan/safvan_thesis/node32.html
\gamma & = \sqrt{ \frac{\textrm{Ip}}{2 U_p} },
\end{align}
where Ip is the atom's ionization potential, $U_p$ is the ponderomotive energy
\begin{align}
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponderomotive_energy
U_p & = \frac{e^2 E^2}{4 m \omega^2},
\end{align}
$e$ and $m$ the electron's charge and mass, $E$ the laser's electric field
strength and $\omega$ its angular frequency.

When $\gamma~\ll~1$, the laser field strength is large compared to the ionization
potential. In that case, a bound electron will feel a significant bending of the
atomic potential. For this to happen, the ionization potential Ip must be
smaller than the ponderomotive energy $U_p$. Figure \ref{fig:regimes} shows,
as dashed lines, constant values of the ponderomotive force. In plain line,
the (first) ionization potential of Xenon is plotted. The field dominated regime
lies under this line.

Otherwise, when $\gamma~\gg~1$, the laser field strength is weak compared to
the ionization potential and the later is not as important as before in the
subsequent dynamics. Photon interactions with the cluster is thus dominant and
the quiver motion of electrons in the oscillating laser field is minimum.

Note that the two regimes are not clearly segregated; Keldysh parameter states
which kind of processes dominates but does not prevent them from happening.
Photon processes could happen in the field-dominated regime and the laser field
can still move electrons around in the photon-dominated regime.

         lines represent constant ponderomotive potential $U_p$. The
         demarcation between the two halves happens when the ponderomotive
         potential equals the ionization potential ($U_p = Ip$).
         Note that the present work concentrate on the VUV and XUV regimes
         where photon processes dominates (at the studied intensities).}

In table \ref{tab:ips} the first five ionization potential for the different
rare gas elements used in this thesis (Argon and Xenon) are shown. The values
for Xenon were obtained from a Dirac LDA calculation from Thomas Fennel that
pre-dates the current work and that were used in previous studies as well. For
Argon, Edward

\subsubsection{Long wavelength: The IR regime}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms:ir}
Most femtosecond lasers are Ti:sapphire that have a wavelength of around 800 nm.
This type of lasers sparked the research on clusters. They cover a wide range of
intensity and as such can touch different regimes, from the photon-dominated
one at low intensities to the field-dominated one at larger intensities and
even going up to where relativistic effects cannot be neglected.

\subsubsubsection{Tunnel ionization}
The most striking effect in the IR regime is tunnel
ionization\cite[Chapter~3]{Brabec2009} when intensity reaches 10$^{14}$ W/cm$^2$.
The Coulomb potential of an atom can be bent enough by the (oscillating) laser
field and the probability of a bound electron tunnelling out becomes significant,
as shown on figure \ref{fig:ionization:tunnel}. Tunnel ionization is also
sometimes called optical field ionization (OFI), or more simply field
ionization, since the laser field is the source of the potential bending and
ionization.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.76\columnwidth]{figures/mockups/ionization_tunnel}
 \caption{Tunnel ionization}
 \label{fig:ionization:tunnel}
\end{figure}

Tunnel ionization is at the hart of High Harmonic Generation (HHG) and
attosecond science\cite{Fennel2010}. A laser pulse, normally in the IR regime,
bends the atomic potential bounds electrons are feeling, allowing them to tunnel
out. They are then accelerated in the laser field where they gain energy. When
the laser polarization changes, electrons are forced back onto their parent ion
where they recombine with by emitting high energy photons. The emission spectra,
containing only odd harmonics, shows an intensity decrease as a function of
harmonic number, followed by a plateau and a cutoff. Since the description
of the phenomena in 1993\cite{Corkum1993}, HHG studies expended into its own
sub-field. For example, Murphy \textit{et al.} used the 21st harmonic of a
800 nm Ti:sapphire to ionize xenon clusters\cite{Murphy2008a,Murphy2008b}
with these new 32.6 eV (38 nm) photons.



\subsubsubsection{Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating}
Once electrons are created in the IR regime they can continue to absorb energy
from the laser.
Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating (IBH) is the inverse process of Bremsstrahlung
where an electron emits a photon when deflected, either by a heavier ion in the
case of plasma or by magnetic fields in the case of synchrotrons. IBH is thus
the absorption of a photon which accelerates the electron.
IBH plays an important role in the IR regime where the laser field easily
drives the electrons through the cluster\cite{Fennel2010}. This linear momentum
is redistributed as thermal energy by collisions and scattering on heavier ions.



\subsubsection{Shorter wavelengths: Into the VUV and XUV regime}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms:vuv}

With the help of new FEL facilities, high laser intensities can be reached at
lower wavelength (and thus larger photon energy) than with traditional
femtosecond lasers.

At relatively low intensity (less than 10$^{14}$ W/cm$^2$
\cite{Ramunno2008}), in the photon-dominated regime, atoms and ions
can be ionized by photon absorption. If the photon energy is more than the
electron's biding energy (see table \ref{tab:ips} for numerical values) single
photon ionization will be the dominant energy transfer mechanism.

While not as strong as in the IR regime, IBH is still important in the
VUV\cite{Krainov2000} up to 62 nm\cite{Georgescu2007}.

\subsubsubsection{Photon absorption}
Initially described by Einstein as the photoelectric effect, a bound electron
absorbs a photon from the laser and is promoted to the continuum where it is
free to leave its parent ion. Figure~\ref{fig:ionization:single} shows a
schematic of the mechanism. For example, the first energy level of atomic
Xenon is at -12.27 eV requiring a photon wavelength equal or shorter than
101.1 nm for ionization. These wavelengths are normally called
\textit{vacuum ultra-violet} (VUV) or \textit{extreme ultra-violet} (XUV).

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.38\columnwidth]{figures/mockups/ionization_single}
 \caption{Single photon ionization}
 \label{fig:ionization:single}
\end{figure}

If the photon energy exceed the electron's binding energy, the extra energy
will be transferred as kinetic energy in the
resulting photoelectron. This can thus be used to sample the states in the
target by measuring the photoelectron energy spectrum\cite{Fennel2010}.

However, if the photon energy is less than the binding energy, than a single
photon cannot ionize an atom. If the intensity is large enough though, the
photon density will be sufficient that many photons can be absorbed during a
small time laps. This effect is called multiple-photon ionization (MPI, not to
be confused with the Message Passing Interface used in parallel programming) and
is a non-linear process. The ionization rate of $\nu$-photons MPI is given
by\cite{Fennel2010}:
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\nu} = \sigma_{\nu} I^{\nu}.
\label{eqn:ionization:rate:mpi}
\end{align}
Being a nonlinear process, multi photon ionization is present at larger
intensities than single photon ionization. But being photon processes, both are
superseded by tunnel ionization at even large intensities (or when
$\gamma~\gg~1$).





% ******************************************************************************
\subsubsection{Regime independent processes}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms:noregime}
Once electrons are created in the cluster, other mechanisms appears. During
impact ionization a first electron collides with an atom and, if it has enough
kinetic energy, will transfer a portion of it to a bound electron, promoting it
to the continuum. Figure \ref{fig:ionization:impact} shoes the energy diagram
of the process.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.76\columnwidth]{figures/mockups/ionization_impact}
 \caption{Impact ionization}
 \label{fig:ionization:impact}
\end{figure}

Similarly to other ionization events, impact ionization is also be described in
terms of cross-sections. These
cross-sections are normally obtained from the semi-empirical Lotz
formula\cite{Lotz1967}:
\begin{align}
\sigma & = \sum_{i}^{N} a_i q_i \frac{\ln{\pa{E/P_i}}}{E P_i} \pa{1 - b_i
\ex{-c_i \pa{E/P_i - 1}}}
\label{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz}
\end{align}
where $P_i$ is the ionization potential of the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ shell and $E$
the impacting electron's kinetic energy \textit{at infinity}.
Data for Xenon was obtained from reference \cite{Tawara1987} for neutrals
% Figure 254, page 317
and reference \cite{Heidenreich2005} for charged states.
% Parameters were taken from figure 1 (a), (b) and (c)
% Note that parameters from figure 1 (a) and (b) for
% the 4+ and 5+ do not give satisfactory results. They were
% obtained by fitting the data directly from the figures





\subsubsection{New regime, new processes}

By going to shorter wavelength, FEL installations allowed experiments at high
intensities in the VUV and XUV regime. But these experiments saw surprisingly
high charge states as the results of the cluster
explosion\cite{Wabnitz2002,Bostedt2010}. For example, Wabnitz \textit{et al.}
saw, at FEL-DESY, Xe$^{4+}$ when Xe$_{80}$ clusters were irradiated with 98 nm,
100 fs FEL pulses of, what was though at the time, $\ten{2}{13}$~W/cm$^2$
intensity. For larger clusters (Xe$_{30,000}$), xenon fragments up to
Xe$^{8+}$ were observed. This was a big surprise considering that the 98~nm
photons (12.7 eV) could only ionize neutral xenon to Xe$^{1+}$ by itself.
Experiments showed that up to 30 photons were absorbed per atom for the largest
clusters. Using a different source of photons and at a different wavelength
(21st harmonic of an 800 nm Ti:sapphire, XUV: 32.6 eV, 38 nm),
Murphy \textit{et al.} observed the same pattern of high charge states in xenon
clusters\cite{Murphy2008a,Murphy2008b}.

Such high charge states could be explained by the previous processes. New
mechanisms were thus proposed to explain these surprising results.


\subsubsubsection{Atomic potentials}
First, Santra \& Greene proposed using \textit{atomic potentials} instead of
the Coulomb potential in a rate equation model (with infinite spacial
extension and
constant density) as seen on figure \ref{fig:heating:atomic_pot}.
This potential shape represents a shielding potential: when
entering the ion vicinity, an electron begins to see an unshielded ionic core.
In reference \cite{Greene2003}, they used an analytic form, fitting one
parameter
with the first ionization potential. Later\cite{Walters2006}, they used a
potential shape generated by the code written by Herman and
Skillman\cite{HS1963} (HS) to describe a more valid potential, based on a
Hartree-Fock formulation. Using these atomic potentials, they saw Xe$^{3+}$,
Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.4}{12}$, $\ten{1.4}{13}$ and
$\ten{7.3}{13}$ W/cm$^2$ respectively for Xe$_{1,500}$ clusters, similarly to
what was seen in at FEL-DESY.

\subsubsubsection{Barrier suppression}
Another model proposed by Siedschlag and Rost\cite{Siedschlag2004} in 2004 was
the barrier suppression in single photon absorption which is shown on figure
\ref{fig:heating:barrier}. Due to the close proximity
of neighbours, the potential barrier between them is lowered and
a photo-transition to the continuum becomes possible, even with a single photon.

\subsubsubsection{Many-Body Recombination}
\textit{Many-Body Recombination} (MBR) was proposed in 2005\cite{Jungreuthmayer2005}
as a simple mechanism to explain the high charge states seen in the
experiments at FEL-DESY. In a strongly coupled plasma, electrons can recombine
easily to a high excited
state after collisions with many bodies. Later, these newly bound electrons can
absorb a new photon from the laser field for another transition to the
continuum -- see figure \ref{fig:heating:mbr}.
Because MBR is much more efficient than three-body
recombination (due to the large density of charged particles), much more
photons are absorbed this way. The simplicity of the
method lies in the fact that in a classical MD simulation, MBR is automatically
included without extra implementation. Jungreuthmayer \textit{et al.} were able
to see Xe$^{3+}$, Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.5}{12}$,
$\ten{1.5}{13}$ and $\ten{7}{13}$ W/cm$^2$ respectively when simulating
Xe$_{1,000}$ clusters.

\subsubsection{Augmented Collisional Ionization}
The previous models are without doubt interesting, but they were developed with
the goal of describing Wabnitz's 2002 experiments at FLASH-DESY. In 2010, Bosted
re-calibrated the intensity used during the 2002 experiments.
Instead of the previously though $\ten{2}{13}$ W/cm$^2$, the power density was
re-calibrated to $\ten{8}{12}$ W/cm$^2$, less than half of the initial value.
Could the different models still produce the same amount of high charge states
seen at the lower intensities?

Our group proposed another mechanism for energy transfer from the laser field
to the cluster. With this two-steps model, an electron might not have enough
kinetic energy to ionize an atom (or ion), but it could still transfer some of
its energy to promote a bound electron to an excited state. Once an atom is
excited, it becomes easier to ionize, due to the large cross-sections of excited
atoms and ions, by subsequent impact from a low energy electron. This gives the
opportunity for low energy electrons to still participate in the cluster
ionization, giving the name \textit{augmented collisional ionization} (ACI) to
the process.

Figure \ref{fig:ionization:aci} shows an energy diagram of ACI and the
different transitions possible.

More details on ACI are given in section \ref{section:papers:aci}, as it is an
important part of this thesis, along with
results on Argon clusters. Section \ref{section:papers:size} studies the cluster
size influence when ACI is used in the XUV regime. In section
\ref{section:papers:100nm} ACI is applied to the VUV regime and the
2002 experiments at FLASH-DESY.







\subsection{Goals}

In view of the previous section, the goal of the current thesis is to increase
to global knowledge of laser-matter interaction. More specifically, the
question of \textit{how} the energy is deposited in a nanoscale object
--a rare gas cluster-- by an
ultra-short and ultra-intense laser pulse will be studied. This interaction
largely depends on the specific target material and on the pulse's wavelength
and duration, both making up the interaction regime. A specific regime will
thus be targeted; mainly short wavelengths, from VUV to XUV, as many questions
raising from recent experiments are still debated.

\fxwarning[margin,noinline]{Really include the following?}
While many tools exist to study laser-mater interaction, it was decided to use
a classical approach since it allows for relatively large systems to be
simulated. Large field fluctuations are also best described with
classical approaches\cite{Fennel2010}.


\subsection{Thesis Outline}
\label{section:intro:outline}
This thesis is presented as a series of published or draft articles.
First, section \ref{section:tools} describes the different tools and models
that were developed and implemented for the current work. While section
\ref{section:tools:md} concentrate on the classical aspect of the problem,
section \ref{section:tools:qfdtd} deals with a quantum approach that was
used. Note that all implementations used are original work; all code packages
were developed under my supervision. The MD package described in section
\ref{section:tools:md} (~16k lines of code) contains 86 \% of code written by
me, 12 \% by Edward Ackad (post-doc) and smaller contributions from Julien Roy
during his summer 2012 internship.

The QFDTD package (~16k lines of code) contains 3 \% of code written by Stan
Hatko while the rest is my original work.

For libraries described in section \ref{section:tools:libraries}, 79 \% of the
ionization library was written by me, 20 \% by Edward Ackad and smaller
contributions from Stan Hatko during his summer 2012 internship. All other
libraries described in section \ref{section:tools:libraries} were fully
written and developed by me.


Section \ref{section:papers:aci} presents the article ``Augmented collisional
ionization via excited states in XUV cluster interactions'' published in 2011
in \textit{Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics}. This
was the first article on the topic and looked at the influence of ACI with Argon
clusters.

Second, section \ref{section:papers:size} presents the article ``Clusters in
intense XUV pulses: Effects of cluster size on expansion dynamics and
ionization''. Also published in 2011 (\textit{Physical Review A)}, Argon
clusters were simulated in the XUV regime and many cluster parameters were
studied.

Later in section \ref{section:papers:qfdtd} the article ``Nonlinear grid mapping
applied to an FDTD-based, multi-center 3D Schr\"odinger equation solver'' is
presented. Published in 2012 in \textit{Computer Physics Communications}, it
explains the QFDTD method and its implementation, with emphasis on the new
nonlinear mapping introduced for faster calculation.

Finally, section \ref{section:papers:100nm} contains the draft of the article
\fxfatal[margin,noinline]{Finish the 100nm paper}
``Revisiting the 100nm experiment with ACI''. In it, ACI is
applied to the VUV regime and Xenon clusters, with similar parameters as the 2002
FEL experiment. This is an important step as the previous theoretical works
used to explain the experiment's results used an intensity that was
recalibrated in 2010. We show in the article that ACI can explain the high
charge states seen in experiments, even at the lower intensity.

Additionally, section \ref{section:other} specifies other, non-published,
contributions that were made during the years. The reader will find, in appendix
\ref{appendix:code}, an overview of the usage of the different simulation
packages and libraries developed.
