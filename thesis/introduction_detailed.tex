give the reader an overview picture of the field. The following will go
into more details.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Goals}
In view of the previous section, the goal of the current thesis is to increase
to global knowledge of laser-matter interaction. More specifically, the
question of \textit{how} the energy is deposited in a nanoscale object by an
ultra-short and ultra-intense laser pulse is important. This interaction
largely depends on the specific target material and on the pulse's wavelength
and duration, both making up the interaction ``regime''. A specific regime will
thus be targeted; mainly short wavelengths, from VUV to XUV, as many questions
raising from recent experiments are still debated.

\subsection{Laser-Cluster interaction}
\cite{Reinhard2004}


\subsubsection{Clusters}
\label{section:intro:clusters:clusters}

Clusters of atoms are an extremely useful tool to study laser-matter
interaction. They are experimentally easy to produce since many
years\cite{Haberland1994}. Their size and constitution can be varied almost at
will \cite{Martin1996}.

\cite{Fennel2010}

\subsubsection{Energy Absorption Mechanisms}
\label{section:intro:clusters:heating}
FIXME: Rename ``heating'' to something else.

Specify that the different mechanisms depends on the regime (material and
wavelength).

Don't talk about tunnel ionization. Just mention it, maybe one paragraph (not
one page). Giving Keldysh parameter, we are most interested in another regime.

TALK ABOUT IBH HERE!!!


\subsubsubsection{Single Photon Ionization}

\end{itemize}

The first energy absorption mechanisms is single photon ionization. Initially
described described by Einstein as the photoelectric effect, a bound electron
absorbs a photon from the laser and is promoted to the continuum where it is
free to leave its parent ion. Figure~\ref{fig:ionization:single} describes
shows the mechanism in detail. For the process to be present, the photon energy
needs to be at least the binding energy of the electron. In the case of
atomic Xenon, the first energy level is at -12.3 eV which requires a photon
of a wavelength equal or shorter than 100.8 nm. These wavelength are normally
called \textit{vacuum ultra-violet} (VUV) and also \textit{extreme
ultra-violet} (XUV).

\emptyfig{Single photon ionization}{fig:ionization:single}

The photon's extra energy will be transferred as kinetic energy in the
resulting photoelectron. This can thus be used to sample the states in the
target by measuring the photoelectron energy spectrum.

Implementing single photon ionization in the model is done through a
transition rate which is itself obtained from the cross-section. Because
cross-sections can be obtained from experiments for any kind of target, it is
easily integrated into the model.

The rate of single photon ionization $\Gamma$ is obtained using the laser
pulse intensity profile $I\pa{t}$ and cross-section $\sigma$:
\begin{align}
\Gamma & = I\pa{t} \sigma\pa{\omega}
\end{align}
For the present work, Xenon cross-sections $\sigma\pa{\omega}$ were obtained
from \cite{West1978} and Argon from \cite{Marr1976}.

Once the rate $\Gamma$ is calculated, it is weighted\cite{Lax2006} by the time
step size and compared to a random number $r$:
\begin{align}
1 - \e{-\Gamma \Delta t} > r
\end{align}
When the previous test succeeds, ionization takes place and a new electron is
created in the code with its kinetic energy set as the difference between the
ionization potential and the photon energy. Then, the intensity profile of the
laser $I\pa{t}$ is decreased by one photon for better description of low fluence
pulses.





\subsubsubsection{Impact Ionization}
Impact ionization can also be described in terms of cross-sections. These
cross-sections are normally obtained from the semi-empirical Lotz
formula\cite{Lotz1967}:
\begin{align}
\sigma & = \sum_{i}^{N} a_i q_i \frac{\ln{\pa{E/P_i}}}{E P_i} \pa{1 - b_i
\ex{-c_i \pa{E/P_i - 1}}}
\label{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz}
\end{align}
where $P_i$ is the ionization potential of the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ shell and $E$
the impacting electron's kinetic energy \textit{at infinity}.
Data for Xenon was obtained from Ref. \cite{Tawara1987} for neutrals
% Figure 254, page 317
and Ref. \cite{Heidenreich2005} for charged states.
% Parameters were taken from figure 1 (a), (b) and (c)
% Note that parameters from figure 1 (a) and (b) for
% the 4+ and 5+ do not give satisfactory results. They were
% obtained by fitting the data directly from the figures

Special care needs to be taken with equation \eqref{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz}
as it was obtained for electrons coming ``from infinity''. In the case of
clusters, electrons are not coming from an infinite distance. We thus need to
extrapolate the kinetic energy of the electron as if it was coming from
infinity. For this, when impact ionization is tested on an electron, its
potential energy with respect to the impacted ion is removed from the kinetic
energy. This effectively gets an energy far from the ion. The cluster
environment is taken into account by considering the potential from the cluster
at the impacted ion as the threshold under which the bound electron lies.
Figure \ref{fig:ionization:impact} shows the energy diagram used during the
process.

\subsubsubsection{Tunnel Ionization}
Laser mater interaction cannot be studied without at least mentioning
\textit{tunnel} or \textit{field ionization}. For sufficiently strong laser
fields and long wavelength, the Coulomb potential of an atom can be bent enough
that the probability of a bound electron tunnelling out becomes significant, as
shown on figure \ref{fig:ionization:tunnel}.

\emptyfig{Tunnel ionization}{fig:ionization:tunnel}

The Keldysh adiabatic parameter $\gamma$ separates two regimes\cite{Fennel2010}.
On one side tunnel ionization is dominant and $\gamma \ll 1$, while single
photon ionization dominates when $\gamma~\gg~1$. The regime of interest in the
current work has $\gamma \gg 1$ and as such, tunnel ionization is not
considered.


\subsubsubsection{Other mechanisms}
Other mechanisms were proposed in lights of results from recent experiments at
FEL installations. Because the previous mechanisms cannot explain by themselves
the results, many different groups proposed extra mechanisms.


First, Santra \& Greene proposed using \textit{atomic potentials} instead of a
pure Coulomb one in a rate equation model (with infinite spacial extension and
constant density). This potential shape represents a shielding potential: when
entering the ion vicinity, an electron begins to see an unshielded ionic core.
In Ref. \cite{Greene2003}, they used an analytic form, fitting one parameter
with the first ionization potential. Later\cite{Walters2006}, they used a
potential shape generated by the code written by Herman and
Skillman\cite{HS1963} (HS) to describe a more valid potential, based on a
Hartree-Fock formulation. Using these atomic potentials, they saw Xe$^{3+}$,
Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.4}{12}$, $\ten{1.4}{13}$ and
$\ten{7.3}{13}$ W/cm$^2$ respectively for Xe$_{1,500}$ clusters.

Another model proposed by Siedschlag and Rost\cite{Siedschlag2004} in 2004 was
the barrier suppression in single photon absorption. Due to the close proximity
of neighbours, a transition to the continuum in the isolated atom case could be
possible with a single photon when neighbours lowered the barrier.

\textit{Many-Body Recombination} (MBR) was proposed in 2005
as a simple mechanism to explain the high charge states seen in VUV
experiments at FEL-DESY\cite{Jungreuthmayer2005}. In a strongly coupled plasma
generated by the VUV pulse, electrons can recombine easily to a high excited
state. Later, these newly bound electrons can absorb a photon from the laser
field, re-ionizing it. Because MBR is much more efficient than three-body
recombination, much more photons are absorbs this way. The simplicity of the
method lies in the fact that in a classical MD simulation, MBR is automatically
included without extra implementation. Jungreuthmayer \textit{et al.} were able
to see Xe$^{3+}$, Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.5}{12}$,
$\ten{1.5}{13}$ and $\ten{7}{13}$ W/cm$^2$ respectively when simulating
Xe$_{1,000}$ clusters.


\subsubsubsubsection{Augmented Collisional Ionization}
The previous models are without doubt interesting, but they were developed with
the goal of describing Wabnitz's 2002 experiments. In 2010, Bosted
re-calibrated the intensity used during the 2002 experiments at FLASH-DESY.
Instead of the previously though $\ten{2}{13}$ W/cm$^2$, the power density was
re-calibrated to $\ten{8}{12}$ W/cm$^2$, less than half of the initial value.
Could the different models still produce the same amount of high charge states
seen at the lower intensities?

Our group proposed another mechanism for energy transfer from the laser field
to the cluster. In the case of MBR, electrons recombine to highly excited
states to be later re-ionized.
