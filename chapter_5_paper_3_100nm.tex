\subsection{Author contributions}
The MD package was mostly written by N. B., as was the text. The ACI cross-sections were calculated
by E. A. All post processing scripts used to analyze data and generate figures
were written by N. B. Data generation and analysis was performed by N. B.
All authors contributed to the discussion.
