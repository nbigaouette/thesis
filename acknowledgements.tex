Graduate studies is a gargantuan challenge full of difficulties, disappointment
and discouragement. It is also greatly enriching, satisfying and something to
be proud of. Even though I present here my own thesis, many great people were
behind me and helping me surpass myself.

I would like to first thank my supervisor, professor Lora Ramunno, for allowing
me to pursue my graduate studies under her umbrella. I am glad she trusted me
as her first PhD student and I hope to have come up to her expectations. Even
though difficulties sometimes emerged, I am greatly thankful of the trust she
had in me. She gave me the freedom and the tools I needed to fulfill my goals
and ideas. She gave me the responsibility of both the purchase and maintenance
of her two clusters, an invaluable experience. She advised my wisely during the
years. I hope the end of my studies will not mean the end of some collaboration.

I would also like to thank Edward ``Eddie'' Ackad for the numerous and deep
discussions on both professional and personal mater. He never refused to answer
my questions, even pushing me to answer them myself instead of blindly answering.
You are a good friend that I'm already missing.

Moving to a different city, in a different culture and language can be
challenging but the many friends I've made in Ottawa supported me without
questions. I must name Charles Varin and Martin Bertrand who became true
friends that I will hopefully keep after my move back to Montreal.

I cannot thank enough my beautiful and sweet Christine that supported me during
all these long years, remotely at first and more closely during the last one.
You've been so supportive, patient and understanding with me, at all times,
the best as the worsts. You never stopped believing in me.
I deeply thank you from my heart for always being there for me.
You've been a saint to endure my countless absent hours. I sincerely cannot
wait to be back in your arms and enjoy our time together as a family of soon
three.

I love you, and always will.
