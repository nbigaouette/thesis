Thesis Outline

====== Questions ======
  - Which structure for the intro?
  - How and where to talk about second paper (cluster size)?
  - Where to put my own contributions? Directly in the text? As a separate section?

====== Introduction ======

===== Notes =====
Possibilities:
  - First part with general intro to explain where I'm going with general litt. search. Second part in more details with more specific citations. Second part includes models descriptions.
  - One part of intro with the big picture, second part with an intro for each paper.
  - Intro with the big picture and details. Before each paper, add an introduction.
  - Intro with one topic per section with theory on it. Second part with description of my work.
  - Merge all introductions into a global intro, stating where each paper is fitting (like M. Bertrand)

===== First Possibility =====
First part with general intro to explain where I'm going with general litt. search. Second part in more details with more specific citations. Second part includes models descriptions.


==== General objectives ====

~5 pages. "Big picture". Same as detailed, but simplified. The goal is to let 
the reader understands where I am going, why I'm doing it, before he starts 
reading. This should allow him to grasp my explanations more easily.
General litterature search goes here.

  - Big picture -- Story
    - Study and control atoms and molecules using light
    - Biomolecules imaging
      - X-Ray crystallography failing for many biomolecules, proteins
      - Short wavelength (X-rays) required
        - High energy absorption: single shot required
    - Ultra short length-scales and ultra fast time-scales
    - Dynamics probing: molecular and electronic
    - $\rightarrow$ Molecular movie
    - Light-Matter
      - Extremes scales well understood (solid vs. single atom)
      - What about in-between? ``Intermediate'' systems: nanoparticles
    - Wavelength
      - lot of work @ 800 nm
      - HHG after tunnel ionization
      - FEL allows much shorted wavelengths, where less work has been done
      - Recent studies @ 100 nm and 32 nm $\rightarrow$ surprising results
    - Cluster studies
      - Nano-scale objects
      - Solid density
      - Experimentally accessible
      - Small system (numerically solvable)
      - Boundary effects
      - Absorb energy more efficiently than gas. Emission of:
        - Highly energetic electrons (~10 keV)
        - Highly charged ions (MeV ?)
        - X-Rays
        - Fusion? Neutrons?
    - Is energy absorption well understood?
    - Heating mechanisms (general description)
      - Current

  - Methodology and Tools
    - Molecular Dynamics (MD)
      - Classical approximation to particles dynamics
      - Interaction of every pair of particles is calculated
        - Tracking of every particles in the system
        - Scales as O(N2)
          - Good for small clusters
          - Intractable for larger clusters
      - Writing of MD code and ionization library from scratch
        - Why from scratch? we had specific needs:
        - New particles created
        - Ionization routines
        - Previous tools (treecode) not satisfactory
      - Potential shapes
      - Quantum effects added as cross-sections
        - Single photon ionization
        - Impact ionization
        - Tunnel (possible, not used)
        - Impact excitation (ACI)
    - Quantum FDTD
      - Study effect of a laser field and cluster environment on:
        - Ionization
        - Cross-sections
        - Grid-based
          - Scales as O(N3)
          - High precision required close to atoms $\rightarrow$ Non-linear mapping
          - Acceleration through OpenCL and GP-GPUs
      - Study the quantum states in a cluster environment: is ACI a valid model?
        - We needed a quantum solver to look at states
        - Past experience with FDTD showed great potential
        - FDTD easy to understand, implement and parallelize
        - $\rightarrow$ QFDTD/Mapping paper
    - Acceleration through OpenCL and GP-GPUs

====== Discussion and Conclusion ======

==== QFDTD ====
  - Interesting project
  - Imaginary time:
    - Fast and easy to get eigenstates and eigenenergies
    - Hard to have time dependent potential (laser)
    - Requires an infinite potential box --> overall gradient in potential causes problem
  - Real time:
    - All states simulated at same time
    - Allow for time dependent potential (laser)
    - Extreme running time due to small time step (caused by small cells)
  - Still requires work
    - No cross sections calculation
    - Cluster environment influence possible
    - Single electron approximation
