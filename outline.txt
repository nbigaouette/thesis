=== Detailed Introduction ===
  - Big picture -- Story
    - Study and control atoms and molecules using light
    - Biomolecules imaging
      - X-Ray crystallography failing for many biomolecules, proteins
      - Short wavelength (X-rays) required
        - High energy absorption: single shot required
    - Ultra short length-scales and ultra fast time-scales
    - Dynamics probing: molecular and electronic
    - $\rightarrow$ Molecular movie
    - Light-Matter
      - Extremes scales well understood (solid vs. single atom)
      - What about in-between? ``Intermediate'' systems: nanoparticles
    - Wavelength
      - lot of work @ 800 nm
      - HHG after tunnel ionization
      - FEL allows much shorted wavelengths, where less work has been done
      - Recent studies @ 100 nm and 32 nm $\rightarrow$ surprising results
    - Cluster studies
      - Nano-scale objects
      - Solid density
      - Experimentally accessible
      - Small system (numerically solvable)
      - Boundary effects
      - Absorb energy more efficiently than gas. Emission of:
        - Highly energetic electrons (~10 keV)
        - Highly charged ions (MeV ?)
        - X-Rays
        - Fusion? Neutrons?
    - Is energy absorption well understood?
    - Current heating mechanisms
      - Single photon ionization
      - Impact ionization
      - Tunnel ionization
    - Proposed new heating mechanisms:
      - Barrier lowering (for single photon)
      - Atomic potential
      - MBR
      - Impact excitation (ACI)
  - Thesis goals:
    - Study the influence of these on the cluster dynamics, energy absorption and distribution
      - laser field
      - cluster environment
    - Introduce a simple new mechanism (ACI)
  - Methodology and Tools
    - Molecular Dynamics (MD)
      - Writing of MD code and ionization library from scratch
        - Why from scratch? we had specific needs:
        - New particles created
        - Ionization routines
        - Previous tools (treecode) not satisfactory
      - Classical approximation to particles dynamics
      - Tracking of every particles in the system
      - Quantum effects added as cross-sections
        - Single photon ionization
        - Impact ionization
        - Tunnel (possible, not used)
        - Impact excitation (ACI)
      - Interaction of every pair of particles is calculated
        - Scales as O(N2)
          - Good for small clusters
          - Intractable for larger clusters
          - Acceleration through OpenCL and GP-GPUs
    - Quantum FDTD
      - Study effect of a laser field and cluster environment on:
        - Ionization
        - Cross-sections
        - Grid-based
          - Scales as O(N3)
          - High precision required close to atoms $\rightarrow$ Non-linear mapping
          - Acceleration through OpenCL and GP-GPUs
      - Study the quantum states in a cluster environment: is ACI a valid model?
        - We needed a quantum solver to look at states
        - Past experience with FDTD showed great potential
        - FDTD easy to understand, implement and parallelize
        - $\rightarrow$ QFDTD/Mapping paper

Contributions:
  - MD from scratch
  - Libraries from scratch
  - QFDTD from scratch
