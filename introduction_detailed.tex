\section{Laser-Cluster interaction}

\subsection{Clusters of atoms and strong laser fields}

Clusters of atoms have been in use for a longer time than we might normally
think. Gold clusters were already used in ancient Rome for their optical
properties; their size could be controlled to produce different glass colours.
Gustav Mie was the first to theoretically describe the interaction of light
with (gold) spheres in 1908, explaining the light absorption dependence
on cluster size. During the last part of the twentieth century, the discovery of
C$_{60}$ fullerenes marked the real beginning of cluster studies.
\lrnote[noinline,margin]{any citations you can add to the above?}

As the Roman saw, the size of these nanoparticles is a key property. Techniques to fully
control the size of produced clusters allowed a wide range of studies and
applications.

\lrnote{romans used gold clusters as you mentioned, and the last sentence as it reads seems to refer to solid-state type nanoparticles.  so you need to introduce rare gas clusters - since this is the base of the ultrafast experiments. add a few sentences here on that topic, where you can describe their generation through pushing gas through nozzles etc.}

\lrnote[noinline,margin]{again, adding citations to the above would help}

Along with the recent developments and advances in the nanosciences,
the advance of high-power and short duration lasers opened the
door for ground breaking ultra-fast studies. With femtosecond
(1 fs = 10$^{-15}$ s) lasers it became possible to study electron motion,
similarly to a camera flash that captures a moving scene.

\lrnote{make reference to attosecond science, rare gas atoms, and provide a reference to a book or review article - I moved the paragraph below to this spot. you'll have to clean it up a bit, with regards to the definition of "infrared":}
The IR regime sparked a new field of ultrafast physics. By stripping electrons
from their parent ion through tunnel ionization and accelerating them in the
laser's strong electric field, train of pulses of high harmonics can be generated (HHG).
Taking place during a single femtosecond pulse, this train of smaller pulses
can reach the attosecond \mbox{(1 as = 10$^{-18}$ s)} duration, an exciting developing field.





The study of the interaction of rare gas clusters with femtosecond lasers represents a
merging of nano and ultrafast science.
%
Many femtosecond lasers
have a wavelength of 800 nm in the infrared (IR) and cluster have been studied
thoroughly with this ``long'' wavelength. Investigation of energetic
electrons (keV) or highly charged ions (MeV) emission, X-rays production or even
table-top neutron sources\cite{Krainov2007} were performed since the
1990s\cite{Haberland1994,Brabec2009}.

Clusters are invaluable tools because they bridge the gap between single atoms
and solids. Their high density allows them to exhibit collective effects similarly
to bulk materials while their small
size increases their surface to volume ratio.
At the smallest range, clusters can be used as models for small molecules and
at the opposite they still present interesting optical properties even at 10,000
atoms\cite{Reinhard2004}.

Additionally to their great size scalability, clusters explosion by-products
after interaction with a strong laser field are accessible, revealing detailed
information about the dynamics. For example, time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometry can reveal the ions charge state spectrum which
is a signature of the amount
of energy absorbed from the laser pulse. This kind of data is not accessible
in the case of laser-bulk interaction since the majority of matter stays
in the solid.

Clusters of atoms can be composed of different elements. Rare gas atoms have
closed outer electronic shells which makes them less prone to chemical
reactions and so don't interact much with each other. Rare-gas clusters are
thus weakly bound by Van der Waals forces and generally form
an icosahedral structure\cite{Martin1996}. The electronic wavefunctions are
more localized around the nucleus than in metal clusters which simplifies the
treatment of the cluster environment.

A critical characteristic of laser-cluster interaction for the present
work is the fact that clusters can be studied numerically. Full quantum resolution
is not possible even for clusters consisting of a couple of atoms, while on the
other range of the methods spectrum rates equations and (nano)plasma models are
too macroscopic to reflect the large fields gradient present during cluster
dynamics\cite{Fennel2010}. The tool of choice for this problem is Molecular Dynamics
(MD) where dynamics are treated classically; Newton's equations of motion are
solved at each time steps and quantum effects are included using specific rates.

The importance of laser-cluster interaction as an investigative tool
can be seen by the vast amount of work on the subject, mainly
in the IR regime\cite{Fennel2010}. Varin \textit{et al.}\cite{Varin2012}
recently developed an electrodynamic
particle-in-cell (PIC) code for IR studies on pre-ionized clusters. PIC methods
have a better scaling than MD in terms of particles number and since they treat
the electromagnetic field dynamically (through Maxwell's equations) field
retardation effects are taken into account, which can be important for large
clusters. On the down side PIC methods don't have the precision of MD for close
range interactions and collisions. A novel addition by Varin \textit{et al.}
is to add microscopic corrections to PIC for more realistic close range
interactions\cite{Peltz2012}.
Since the grid must resolve the electromagnetic wave,
PIC simulations can thus be a challenge when the wavelength is small
but this opens the door to a new frontier of modelling.

The interest of this thesis is in modelling short wavelength interaction with
clusters. In recent years, laser light sources have been moving to shorter
wavelengths due to groundbreaking new Free Electron Lasers (FEL)
facilities; Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV), Extreme Ultra-Violet (XUV), soft X-Rays
and even hard X-rays are now accessible. In FELs, relativistic electrons are sent
through an ondulator in which they emit a coherent pulse, tunable in wavelength
(by changing the electrons initial energy)
from microwaves to X-rays\cite{Brabec2009,Ackermann2007a,Pellegrini2012} at
unprecedented intensities. A single 10 to 100 fs FEL pulse can contain 10$^{13}$
photons, the same amount produced by the best synchrotrons during
\textit{one second}\cite{Bostedt2009}. Even though FEL installations require
large facilities, some researchers are working on a smaller version, as
``short'' as 55 meters\cite{Shintake2008}.

At shorter wavelengths, treating the laser as simply an electromagnetic field
is not valid anymore and photons must be considered.
The Keldysh parameter $\gamma$ dictates which regime must be considered. In
cases where $\gamma \ll 1$ the electric field of the laser is strong enough that
the ion's Coulomb potential is distorted to such an extent
that electrons can tunnel out.
However, when $\gamma \gg 1$ the laser frequency is too large compared to the
field's strength. Ionization is then dominated by single (or a few) photon
absorption.
%
\lrnote{I would clarify that ionization is dominated by single (and sometimes a few) photon absorption processes. this is because field process are still considered "multiphoton" and because even in the XFEL they are relying on significant Xray diffraction from single shots. so just clarify you're talking about ionization.}
%
Experiments in
2002\cite{Wabnitz2002,Bostedt2009} at
DESY's FLASH (\textbf{F}ree-electron-\textbf{Las}er in \textbf{H}amburg)
on Xenon clusters in the VUV regime (98~nm wavelength, 12.65~eV photon energy)
had $\gamma$ values between 8 and
100 putting it in the regime dominated by photon processes.
During these experiments, unexpected high charge states were seen that could not
be explained by traditional energy transfer mechanisms. Theoretical work was
then performed for explaining these high charge states; these models will be
covered in section \ref{section:intro:mechanisms}.



At shorter wavelength,
Argon clusters were studied in the XUV regime\cite{Bostedt2008}. The 32.8~nm
(37.8~eV) photons are 5 eV above Argon's first ionization
potential. It was found that ionization is a multistep process of
photo-electrons emission and because of the subsequent charge buildup in the
cluster, the electron energy distribution is non-thermal.

In 2006, a proof-of-principle experiment showed that that it is possible to
do (soft) X-rays diffraction imaging using FLASH pulses\cite{Chapman2006}:
Chapman \textit{et al.} were able to image a micrometer-wide stick-figure pattern
engraved on a 20 nm thin film. Imaging was possible even though the sample was
eventually destroyed by the high intensity X-ray laser pulse.
Similar studies on Xenon clusters were performed in 2010\cite{Bostedt2010} where
diffraction patterns where obtained for clusters in single laser shots
at 13 nm (95.37 eV).

More multiphoton
ionization experiments on Nitrogen, Argon, Neon and Helium were performed at
FLASH.

At the even shorter wavelength of 13.7 nm (90.5~eV), Xenon clusters irradiated at
$\ten{7.5}{15}$~W/cm$^2$ produced charged states of up to 21+\cite{Sorokin2007,Richter2009},
meaning 60 XUV photons had to be absorbed per atom. Xenon's giant 4d
resonance is suspected to be the cause of these high charge states.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC, Stanford, is another important
FEL facility where the first FEL hard X-rays lasing was
performed in 2010\cite{Emma2010,Schneider2010}. Single Neon atoms were studied in
this hard X-rays source\cite{Young2010} showing fully stripped neon nucleus.
Later in 2011, protein nanocrystallography was performed \cite{Chapman2011}
on photosystem~I, a large cell membrane protein of algae, plants, and some
bacteria implicated in photosynthesis. By using pulses shorter
than the explosion time scale, the protein's structure could be reconstructed,
opening the door for the determination of the structure of biomolecules that
do not crystallize correctly for use in traditional crystallography studies.
In the same Nature issue, Mimivirus, the second largest known virus at 450 nm
of diameter, was imaged using single shot hard X-ray pulse (0.69~nm,
1.8~keV)\cite{Seibert2011}. LCLS pulses have a duration of 70 to 500 fs at
wavelengths of 0.15 nm to 2.2 nm\cite{Pellegrini2011}.

Cluster studies continue to this day in regimes such as VUV\cite{Arbeiter2011},
XUV\cite{Murphy2008a,Murphy2008b,Krikunova2012} and X-rays\cite{Ziaja2009b}.

\subsection{Microscopic mechanisms underlying cluster dynamics}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms}

Interaction of light with single rare gas atoms is a well studied problem but
the collective effects of the high density of atoms in a cluster gives rise to
many different mechanisms of energy absorption and redistribution throughout the
cluster. This section will cover the different mechanisms by going over the
different wavelength regimes, from the long wavelength (IR) to the shorter XUV.

The different mechanisms described in this section can be sorted into two main
families. First, the laser-driven, or laser-particles, mechanisms are the
simplest as they are the result of the direct interaction between the laser
and the particles. They are normally described using isolated atoms but can
be adapted to take into consideration the cluster environment; see section
\ref{section:intro:Vb} for details. For example, single-photon ionization where
one photon is absorbed by a bound electron and gets promoted to the continuum is
a direct interaction between the laser and the atom.

The second family consist of indirect mechanisms were particles-particles
interaction are vital. These indirect mechanisms don't necessarily transfer
energy from the laser to the cluster but are still an important aspect of
cluster dynamics as they can affect energy absorption and charge state spectra.
For example, impact ionization where
an electron hits an atom and promotes a bound electron to the continuum by
sharing some of its kinetic energy is independent on the presence of a laser
(but obviously still requires free electrons). As will be described later,
indirect mechanisms are still important for the cluster dynamics and can also
help energy transfer from the laser to the cluster.

The cluster environment, due to the large particle density, has an important
influence on both the laser-driven and particles-particles interaction and
aspects of how to incorporate its effect on laser-cluster interaction
is a substantial aspect of the current work.

Most studies on clusters are performed on femtosecond IR laser
pulses which span a large range of intensity. These kind of lasers are
widespread and dominated by Ti:sapphire pumped with another laser. The pump
laser (Nd:YAG) lases at 1064 nm and is frequency-doubled to 534 nm in a
nonlinear crystal. The Ti:sapphire then emits 800 nm light with a wide range of
intensity.

The advance of Free-Electron Lasers (FEL) allowed high intensity of VUV, XUV and
even X-rays laser source. As described previously, FEL require large facilities,
mainly due to the linear particle accelerator required to seed the ondulator
with relativistic electrons and as such are scarce and their intensity is limited
compared to Ti:sapphire lasers. Nevertheless their
tunable wavelength allows them to access different interesting regimes.

The different regimes are shown on figure \ref{fig:regimes}.
The vertical axis shows the different regimes as
function of wavelengths. They will be presented, in the following subsection,
in order of wavelength, from longest to shortest. At each regime, dominant
processes will be presented.

% http://www.spacewx.com/Docs/ISO_PRF_21348_e_review.pdf
As can be seen on figure \ref{fig:regimes}, the laser's intensity also dictates
the regime.
The Keldysh adiabatic parameter $\gamma$ separates regimes where ionization
processes are dominated by either photons or field\cite{Long2010} and reads
\begin{align}
% http://www.iuac.res.in/atmol/~safvan/safvan_thesis/node32.html
\gamma & = \sqrt{ \frac{\textrm{Ip}}{2 U_p} } = \frac{\omega}{\omega_t},
\end{align}
where Ip is the atom's ionization potential, $U_p$ is the ponderomotive energy
\begin{align}
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponderomotive_energy
U_p & = \frac{e^2 E^2}{4 m \omega^2},
\end{align}
$e$ and $m$ the electron's charge and mass, $E$ the laser's electric field
strength, $\omega$ its angular frequency and $\omega_t$ the tunnelling
frequency:
\begin{align}
\omega_t & = \frac{e E}{\sqrt{2 m \textrm{Ip}}}
\end{align}

When $\gamma~\ll~1$, the laser field strength is large compared to the ionization
potential. In that case, a bound electron will feel a significant bending of the
atomic potential and will thus have a significant probability of tunnelling out.
For this to happen, the ionization potential Ip must be
smaller than the ponderomotive energy $U_p$. Figure \ref{fig:regimes} shows,
as dashed lines, constant values of the ponderomotive energy. The plain line shows
a ponderomotive energy value equal to the (first) ionization potential of Xenon.
The field dominated regime lies under this line.

Otherwise, when $\gamma~\gg~1$, the laser field strength is weak compared to
the ionization potential and the later is not as important as before in the
subsequent dynamics. The amplitude of the electron's quiver motion in the laser
field is given by
\begin{align}
% Georgescu2007a, page 3
x_q & = \frac{F}{\omega^2}
\label{eqn:quiver}
\end{align}
where $F$ is the force of the laser field and $\omega$ its angular frequency.
When $\gamma~\gg~1$, the quiver amplitude $x_q$ is minimum; the electric field
oscillates too rapidly for the electrons to feel it and photon interactions with
the cluster is thus dominant.

Note that the two regimes are not clearly segregated; Keldysh parameter
predicts which process will dominate -- photon processes or field processes --
but both can occur. Photon processes could happen in the field-dominated
regime and the laser field can still move electrons around in the photon-dominated regime.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{figures/regimes}
\caption{Wavelength and intensity regimes. For Xenon, lower right half is dominated
         by field processes while upper left half by photon processes. Diagonal
         lines represent constant ponderomotive potential $U_p$. The
         demarcation between the two halves happens when the ponderomotive
         potential equals the ionization potential ($U_p = Ip$).
         Note that the present work concentrate on the VUV and XUV regimes
         where photon processes dominates (at the studied intensities).}
\label{fig:regimes}
\end{figure}

In table \ref{tab:ips} the first ionization energies for the different
rare gas elements used in this thesis (Argon and Xenon) are shown. As can be
seen from the table and figure \ref{fig:regimes}, Xenon and Argon can be
single-photon ionized in the VUV regime where photons of 15.76 (for Argon)
and 12.13 eV (for Xenon) are possible. While Xenon's 5p states have the smallest
Ip's, the cross-section for photoionization of the 4d shell is approximately ten
times larger at 13.7 nm (90.5 eV) -- the so called xenon giant 4d
resonance\cite{Becker1986} -- making ionization of these inner-shells
possible\cite{Thomas2009,Ackad2013}.

Let us now turn to a more detailed examination of the different mechanisms
present in the different regimes, as well as some regime-independent processes.



\subsubsection{Long wavelength: The IR regime}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms:ir}

Most femtosecond lasers are Ti:sapphire that have a wavelength centred around 800 nm.
This type of lasers sparked the research on clusters. They cover a wide range of
intensity and as such can touch different regimes, from the photon-dominated
one at low intensities to the field-dominated one at larger intensities and
even going up to where relativistic effects cannot be neglected.

One can see how much work was done in the field-dominated (IR) regime over the
years by looking at the wide literature on the subject, see for example ref.
\cite{Fennel2010} or \cite{Ramunno2008}. On the opposite, the VUV and XUV regime
-- the photon-dominated one -- is much less explored and is thus the main
aspect of the present work. Some effects in the IR are still presented here
for clarity. These processes are dominant in the field-dominated regime (see
figure \ref{fig:regimes}).


\subsubsubsection{Tunnel ionization}

The most striking effect in the IR regime is tunnel
ionization\cite[Chapter~3]{Brabec2009} when intensity reaches 10$^{14}$~W/cm$^2$.
The Coulomb potential of an atom can be bent enough by the (oscillating) laser
field and the probability of a bound electron tunnelling out becomes significant,
as shown on figure \ref{fig:ionization:tunnel}. Tunnel ionization is also
sometimes called optical field ionization (OFI), or more simply field
ionization, since one can describe the process as the laser field as the source
of the potential bending and ionization.
\lrnote{I made the change to the last sentence, but
am still not happy with it. it's b/c the laser field picture is really only a
semiclassical quantum picture in the length gauge. i will clarify more when we
talk and maybe we can edit it appropriately then.}


% Above Threshold Ionization (ATI) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_Threshold_Ionization_%28ATI%29
% Strong Field Approximation (SFI)

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{figures/ionization_tunnel}
 \caption{\label{fig:ionization:tunnel}Tunnel ionization. The potential
          due to the laser (red) bends the unperturbed ion potential
          (grey dashed). The electron (blue dot) sitting at the unperturbed
          eigenvalue (magenta) now has a probability to tunnel through the total
          potential barrier (black line). The laser frequency must be small
          enough for the probability to be non-negligible (large wavelength)
          and intensity large enough ($\gamma \ll 1$).}
\end{figure}

Tunnel ionization is at the heart of High Harmonic Generation (HHG) and
attosecond science\cite{Fennel2010}. A laser pulse, normally in the IR regime,
bends the atomic potential bounds electrons are feeling, allowing them to tunnel
out. They are then accelerated in the laser field where they gain energy.
As the laser field changes direction within a laser cycle, electrons are forced
back onto their parent ion where they can
recombine and emit high energy photons. The emission spectra,
containing only odd harmonics, shows an intensity decrease as a function of
harmonic number, followed by a plateau and a cutoff. Since the description
of the phenomena in 1993\cite{Corkum1993}, HHG studies expended into its own
sub-field. For example, Murphy \textit{et al.} used the 21st harmonic of a
800 nm Ti:sapphire to ionize xenon clusters\cite{Murphy2008a,Murphy2008b}
with these new 32.6 eV (38 nm) photons.
For more details on HHG see references~\cite{Levesque2006} and
\cite{Lewenstein2008}.
\lrnote[noinline,margin]{you should be prepared to answer "why only odd harmonics?"}


\subsubsubsection{Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating}

Once electrons are created in the IR regime they can continue to absorb energy
from the laser.
Inverse Bremsstrahlung Heating (IBH) is the inverse process of Bremsstrahlung
where an electron emits a photon when deflected, either by a heavier ion in the
case of plasma, or by magnetic fields in the case of synchrotrons. IBH is thus
the absorption of photons accelerating the electrons\cite{Schlessinger1979}.

For large frequencies, the quiver amplitude of equation \eqref{eqn:quiver} is
small; the electric field oscillates
too rapidly for the electrons to gain significant acceleration. On the other
hand, for smaller frequencies (larger wavelengths) the quiver amplitude can
be significant. In the case of IR, electrons can be pushed outside the cluster
and back in; at $\ten{3}{16}$~W/cm$^2$ and 800~nm, the quiver
amplitude is $x_q \approx 500 a_0$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr
radius\cite{Georgescu2007}, while a Xe$_{1415}$ cluster is~115~$a_0$.

The linear momentum gained by electrons in the laser field is then redistributed
as thermal energy by collisions and scattering on heavier ions.
IBH plays an important role in the IR regime where the laser field easily
drives the electrons through the cluster\cite{Fennel2010}.


The IBH rate is given\cite{Fennel2010} by:
\begin{align}
\left< \dt{E} \right> & = 2 U_p \frac{\tau \omega^2}{\tau^2 \omega^2 + 1}
\end{align}
where $\tau$ is the inverse of the collision electron-ion frequency.

\fxfatal{According to Bostedt2010\cite[page 3]{Bostedt2010}, IBH scales as
$\lambda^{8/3}$ and cites Krainov2000\cite{Krainov2000} and
Krainov2002\cite{Krainov2002}}

With the help of new FEL facilities, high laser intensities can be reached at
lower wavelength (and thus larger photon energy) than with traditional
femtosecond lasers. \textit{Vacuum ultraviolet} (VUV) radiation, ranging from 200 to
10~nm (6.2 to 124~eV), is normally absorbed by the atmosphere. Studying them
requires vacuum chambers (hence the name) or a pure nitrogen propagation medium.
At short wavelengths, the photons can start to ionize inner shell electrons. In
that case, the term \textit{extreme ultraviolet} (XUV, or EUV) is used. XUV wavelengths
range from 121~nm (hydrogen's Lyman alpha line, 10.25 eV) to 10~nm (124~eV).
As the two regimes have overlapping wavelengths, they are often used
interchangeably but XUV is generally used with wavelengths where no
material is known to be transparent\cite{Laane2009}. Note that in other fields
XUV can be used to describe soft X-rays\cite{Eichmeier2008,iso21348}

At relatively low intensity (less than 10$^{14}$~W/cm$^2$
\cite{Ramunno2008}), in the photon-dominated regime, atoms and ions
can be ionized by photon absorption. If the photon energy is more than the
electron's biding energy (see table \ref{tab:ips} for numerical values) single
photon ionization will be the dominant energy transfer mechanism.

While not as strong as in the IR regime, IBH is still important in the
VUV\cite{Krainov2000} up to 62 nm\cite{Georgescu2007}.


\subsubsubsection{Photon absorption}

Initially described by Einstein as the photoelectric effect, a bound electron
absorbs a photon from the laser and is promoted to the continuum where it is
free to leave its parent ion. Figure~\ref{fig:ionization:single} shows a
schematic of the mechanism. For example, the first energy level of atomic
Xenon is at -12.27 eV requiring a photon wavelength equal or shorter than
101.1 nm for ionization.


\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{figures/ionization_single}
 \caption{Single photon ionization for the atomic, isolated model. A photon
          (red) is absorbed by a bound electron (blue) which gets promoted to
          the continuum. The remaining energy $\Delta E$ between the photon's
          and the Ip results in electron's kinetic energy $K_e$.
          Chapter \ref{section:tools} describes the cluster environment
          influence.}
 \label{fig:ionization:single}
\end{figure}

If the photon energy exceed the electron's binding energy, the difference in energy
will be transferred as extra kinetic energy in the
resulting photoelectron. This can thus be used to sample the states in the
target by measuring the photoelectron energy spectrum\cite{Fennel2010}.

However, if the photon energy is less then the binding energy, than a single
photon cannot ionize an atom. If the intensity is large enough though, the
photon density will be sufficient that many photons can be absorbed during a
small time interval.
This effect is called multiple-photon ionization (MPI, not to
be confused with the Message Passing Interface used in parallel programming) and
is a non-linear process. The ionization rate of $\nu$-photons MPI is given
by\cite{Fennel2010}:
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{\nu} = \sigma_{\nu} I^{\nu}.
\label{eqn:ionization:rate:mpi}
\end{align}
Being a nonlinear process, multi photon ionization is present at larger
intensities than single photon ionization. But being photon processes, both are
superseded by tunnel ionization at even larger intensities (or when
$\gamma~\gg~1$).

\lrfatal[noinline,margin]{there is also the above-threshold ionization
regime, which you might want to mention, and was one of the first discoveries in
the atto field}

% \clearpage
\subsubsubsection{Auger effect}

At even shorter wavelength, the photon energy might be large enough not only
to ionize the highest energy electron but also some inner-shell electrons.
When such an inner shell electron gets ionized, it leaves a hole; the atom is
thus in an excited state. An outer shell electron will then transition by
\textit{Auger decay} to the hole. The transition energy is used by a third
electron (the Auger electron) to leave the ion, leaving the latter
doubly-ionized. Figure \ref{fig:auger} shows a diagram of the process.

\begin{figure}

    \end{subfigure}
        \caption{\label{fig:auger}Auger ionization of a xenon 4d electron by a

                 as blue dots with the distance to the core representing their
                 principal quantum numbers $n$.}
\end{figure}

To access core electrons, photons must be highly energetic, normally in X-rays.
While not the focus of the present work, an interesting aspect is that Xenon
atoms have a giant resonance of the (inner-shell) 4d state; the cross-section of
photoionization of the 4d electron is ten times larger than the
one of valence  electrons at 13.7 nm wavelength~(90.5~eV)\cite{Becker1986}.
This process was included in the model for a comparison with a 2009 experiment
by Thomas \textit{et al.}\cite{Thomas2009} on Xenon clusters at FLASH-DESY.
The German group saw clusters becoming nanoplasmas from which the outer shells
ions undergo Coulomb explosion while the relatively neutral core expands
hydrodynamically. These results could be reproduced by our model in a recently
published article entitled ``Recombination effects in soft-x-ray cluster
interactions at the xenon giant resonance'', published in May 2013 in
\textit{New Journal of Physics}\cite{Ackad2013} and included in section
\ref{section:papers:recomb}.

% ******************************************************************************
\subsubsection{Regime independent processes}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms:noregime}

Once electrons are created in the cluster, other mechanisms appear. During
impact ionization a first electron collides with an atom and, if it has enough
kinetic energy, will transfer a portion of it to a bound electron, promoting it
to the continuum. Figure \ref{fig:ionization:impact} shows the energy diagram
of the process.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{figures/ionization_impact}
 \caption{Impact ionization. The colliding electron (blue dot) gives a portion
          of its energy to a bound electron (green dot), promoting it to the
          continuum.}
 \label{fig:ionization:impact}
\end{figure}

Impact ionization can be modelled through cross-sections. These
cross-sections are normally obtained from the semi-empirical Lotz
formula\cite{Lotz1967}:
\begin{align}
\sigma & = \sum_{i}^{N} a_i q_i \frac{\ln{\pa{E/\textrm{Ip}_i}}}{E \textrm{Ip}_i} \pa{1 - b_i
\ex{-c_i \pa{E/\textrm{Ip}_i - 1}}}
\label{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz}
\end{align}
where Ip$_i$ is the ionization potential of the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ shell and $E$
the impacting electron's kinetic energy \textit{at infinity} (or above threshold).

\subsubsection{New regime, new processes}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms:new},

By going to shorter wavelengths, FEL installations allowed experiments at high
intensities in the VUV and XUV regime. These experiments saw surprisingly
high charge states as the results of the clusters
explosion\cite{Wabnitz2002,Bostedt2010}. For example, Wabnitz \textit{et al.}
saw, at FEL-DESY, Xe$^{4+}$ when Xe$_{80}$ clusters were irradiated with 98 nm,
100 fs FEL pulses of, what was though at the time, $\ten{2}{13}$~W/cm$^2$
intensity. For larger clusters (Xe$_{30,000}$), Xenon ions up to
Xe$^{8+}$ were observed. This was a big surprise considering that the 98~nm
photons (12.7 eV) could only ionize neutral Xenon to Xe$^{1+}$ by itself;
data showed that up to 30 photons were absorbed per atom for the largest
clusters. Using a different source of photons and at a different wavelength
(21st harmonic of an 800 nm Ti:sapphire, XUV: 32.6 eV, 38 nm),
Murphy \textit{et al.} observed the same pattern of high charge states in xenon
clusters\cite{Murphy2008a,Murphy2008b}.

Such high charge states could not be explained by the previous processes only.
New mechanisms were thus proposed to explain these surprising results.
The four main models proposed throughout the years are covered next.


\subsubsubsection{Atomic potentials}

First, Santra \& Greene proposed using \textit{atomic potentials} instead of
the Coulomb potential in a rate equation model (with infinite spatial
extension and
constant density) as seen on figure \ref{fig:heating:atomic_pot}.
The atomic nucleus is normally shielded by bound electrons but inside the
electronic cloud the shielding disappears and the nucleus potential is more
important. If an impacting electron can get close enough to the core, it will
feel the unshielded potential.
In reference \cite{Greene2003}, Santra \& Greene used an approximated form for
the atomic potential, fitting one parameter with the first ionization potential.
A later\cite{Walters2006} publication used a
potential shape generated by the code written by Herman and
Skillman\cite{HS1963} (HS) to describe a more realistic
potential, based on a
Hartree-Fock formulation. Using these atomic potentials, they saw Xe$^{3+}$,
Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.4}{12}$, $\ten{1.4}{13}$ and
$\ten{7.3}{13}$~W/cm$^2$ respectively for Xe$_{1,500}$ clusters, similarly to
what was seen in at FEL-DESY.


\subsubsubsection{Barrier suppression}

Another model proposed by Siedschlag and Rost\cite{Siedschlag2004} in 2004 was
the barrier suppression in single photon absorption which is shown on figure
\ref{fig:heating:barrier}. Due to the close proximity
of neighbours, the potential barrier between them is lowered and
a photo-transition to the continuum becomes possible, even with a single photon.

\lrfatal{nic, did we ever talk about the downsides of the rost model?}

\subsubsubsection{Many-Body Recombination}

\textit{Many-Body Recombination} (MBR) was proposed in 2005\cite{Jungreuthmayer2005}
as a simple mechanism to explain the high charge states seen in the
experiments at FEL-DESY. In a strongly coupled plasma, electrons can recombine
easily to a high excited
state after collisions with many bodies. Later, these newly bound electrons can
absorb a new photon from the laser field for another transition to the
continuum -- see figure \ref{fig:heating:mbr}.
Because MBR is much more efficient than three-body
recombination (due to the large density of charged particles), much more
photons are absorbed this way. It was also shown that MBR deposited more energy
in the clusters than traditional IBH.
The simplicity of the
method lies in the fact that in a classical MD simulation, MBR is automatically
included without extra implementation as the high excited states have energies
which are close to each other and can thus be treated classically.
Jungreuthmayer \textit{et al.} were able
to see Xe$^{3+}$, Xe$^{5+}$ and Xe$^{7+}$ for intensities of $\ten{1.5}{12}$,
$\ten{1.5}{13}$ and $\ten{7}{13}$~W/cm$^2$ respectively when simulating
Xe$_{1,000}$ clusters.

\subsection{Contributions of thesis}

The goal of the current thesis is to acquire a better understanding of
laser-matter interaction.
More specifically, the
question of \textit{how} the energy is deposited in a nanoscale object
--a rare gas cluster-- by an
ultra-short and ultra-intense laser pulse will be studied. This interaction
largely depends on the specific target material and on the pulse's wavelength
and duration, both defining the interaction regime. A specific regime will
thus be targeted; mainly short wavelengths, from VUV to XUV, as many questions
raising from recent experiments are still debated.

While many tools exist to study laser-mater interaction, only classical
approaches can be considered as a full quantum calculation, even
with some degree of approximations, is not possible. Clusters become
nanoplasmas quite rapidly and have large charge and field fluctuations inside
them. This and their finite nature makes it hard to use tools such as rate
equations to model them. Pure classical simulations allows for relatively large
systems to be simulated and are thus the tool of choice.

\lrfatal{also remind me to talk to you about justifications of classical
regmies in plasma physics... we might add that discussion here.}

\subsubsection{Tools}

First, section \ref{section:tools} describes the different tools and models
that were developed and implemented to answer our questions. While section
\ref{section:tools:md} concentrate on the classical aspect of the problem,
section \ref{section:tools:qfdtd} describes in detail a quantum approach that
was used named QFDTD for Quantum Finite-Difference Time-Domain.
Note that all implementations used are original work; all code packages
were developed from scratch by me or under my direction and no external packages
were used. The MD package described in
section \ref{section:tools:md} ($\sim$16k lines of code) contains 86~\% of code
written by me, 12~\% by Edward Ackad (postdoctoral fellow) and smaller contributions from
Julien Roy (undergraduate student) during his summer 2012 internship. Furthermore, the QFDTD package
($\sim$16k lines of code) contains 3~\% of code written by Stan Hatko (undergraduate student) while the
rest is my original work. Most tools were written in C++ with Python being used
for analysis and plotting.

For libraries described in section \ref{section:tools:libraries}, 79~\% of the
ionization library was written by me, 20~\% by Edward Ackad and smaller
contributions from Stan Hatko during his summer 2012 internship. All other
libraries described in section \ref{section:tools:libraries} were fully
written and developed by me.

All these powerful tools were extremely useful for my studies and will also allow
the group to continue its investigation of laser-clusters interaction even
after my departure.

Additionally to the models described in
section \ref{section:intro:mechanisms}, a notable new one was
developed that revealed be of great importance in the description of
laser-clusters interaction. This new model is discussed next.


\subsubsection{Augmented Collisional Ionization (ACI)}

Wabnitz's \textit{et al.} experiments at FLASH-DESY in 2002 revealed the
interestingly high charge states in xenon clusters. Since then, different groups
proposed models to explain these results as described in section
\ref{section:intro:mechanisms:new}.
Then, in 2010, Bosted \textit{et al.}
re-calibrated the intensity used during the 2002 experiments.
Instead of the previously thought $\ten{2}{13}$~W/cm$^2$, the intensity was
re-calibrated to $\ten{8}{12}$~W/cm$^2$, less than half of the initial value.
Could the different models still produce the same amount of high charge states
at the lower intensities?

Additionally, in 2008 experiments \cite{Bostedt2008,Murphy2008b} were performed
in the XUV regime near 30~nm~(41~eV). At this wavelength, the photon energy is
too small for inner shell ionization of rare gas atoms, yet too large
(at reported intensities) for any appreciable laser-field-driven processes, such
as collisional heating, that dominate intense laser-cluster interactions at
longer wavelengths. This presents the opportunity to isolate the influence of
the internal electronic structure from the laser-cluster interaction.

Our group thus proposed a new mechanism for energy transfer from the laser field
to the cluster via two-step collisional ionization. With this two-step model, an
electron might not have enough kinetic energy to directly collisionally ionize
an atom (or ion), but it could still transfer some of
its energy to promote a bound electron to an excited state. Once an atom is
excited, it becomes easier to ionize, due to the large cross-sections of excited
atoms and ions, by subsequent impact from a low energy electron. This gives the
opportunity for low energy electrons to still participate in the cluster
ionization, giving the name \textit{augmented collisional ionization} (ACI) to
the process.

Figure \ref{fig:ionization:aci} shows an energy diagram of ACI and the
different transitions possible. This two-step model is implemented using
cross-sections for collisional transition (ground state to excited state and
excited state to continuum), similarly to traditional impact
ionization. See section \ref{section:intro:md:cross-sections} for more
details on cross-sections.

The ACI model revealed to be an important contribution to the field. As will be
seen from the publications, experimental results can be reproduced with this
model.



\subsubsection{Publications}

After the tools are presented in section \ref{section:tools}, the present thesis
consists of a series of four published articles and one article in preparation
where the models and tools are tested and used.


\subsubsubsection{ACI introduction paper}

First, the work on excited states and ACI in clusters was published in the article
``Augmented collisional ionization via excited states in XUV cluster
interactions'' published in 2011 in \textit{Journal of Physics B: Atomic,
Molecular and Optical Physics}\cite{Ackad2011a} and can be found in section
\ref{section:papers:aci} (page \pageref{section:papers:aci}). Argon clusters
(Ar$_{80}$ and Ar$_{147}$) were simulated with parameters used in experiments
at FLASH-DESY in 2008 by Bosted \textit{et al.}\cite{Bostedt2008}.
(32.8 nm -- 37.8 eV, 25 fs and intensities from $\ten{5}{13}$ to
$10^{14}$~W/cm$^{-2}$). It was found that not only ACI could explain the
Ar$^{4+}$ seen at FLASH but also that it
was a dominant process, happening more often than traditional impact ionization.
Due to the efficiency of ACI, high charge states can be reached in shorter time
than previously though which can have a significant impact on biomolecules
imaging. This first ACI article was a stepping stone in the current work as it
showed the validity of the model, as simple as it could be.

\lrfatal{your contributions to this paper.}

\subsubsubsection{Cluster size influence}

Next, section \ref{section:papers:size} presents the article ``Clusters in
intense XUV pulses: Effects of cluster size on expansion dynamics and
ionization''. Also published in 2011 (\textit{Physical Review~A}\cite{Ackad2011b}),
argon clusters were simulated in the XUV regime (32.8 nm,
I~=~$\ten{5}{13}$~W/cm$^{2}$, 25 fs) with cluster sizes from Ar$_{55}$ to
Ar$_{2057}$. It was found that the dynamics is highly collisional and
larger clusters even more so. By rapidly ionizing the lower charge states,
collisional processes will prevent photo-ionization even before the laser pulse
is finished. This mechanism was called \textit{collisionally reduced photoabsorption}.
The amount of energy absorbed through photo-ionization by Ar$_{55}$ clusters was
reduced by 30~\% and 45~\% by Ar$_{2057}$ clusters when collisional processes
are included.
Higher charge states are more abundant and also appears sooner during the
dynamics in large clusters compared to smaller ones. ACI is vital for the
description; 20~\% of ions are in an excited state after the laser peak.
During the laser pulse, the distribution of charge inside clusters is
relatively isotropic but as the simulation evolves, the outer shells tend to
loose electrons more than the core and eventually disintegrate through Coulomb
explosion.
The core stays relatively neutral and expend thermodyamically.

The ion kinetic energy distribution revealed that Ar$^{2+}$  provided most of
the high energy tail. Additionally, the highest charge states had the least
energy. The highest charges states being created in the (neutral) core, the
electrons shield these high charge states, preventing them from accelerating
as much as the outer shells ions.

Electrons thermalize rapidly to a Maxwellian distribution. The larger clusters'
distribution are isotropic due to the high collisional rates while smaller
clusters keep the anisotropy coming from photoionization.

\subsubsubsection{Revisiting the 100 nm experiment}
\fxfatal[noinline,margin]{Synchronize and finish the 100nm paper with its description}

Finally, section \ref{section:papers:100nm} contains the draft of the article
``Augmented Collisional Ionization in the VUV regime; a theoretical study''.
After Wabnitz \textit{et al.}'s
2002 DESY-FEL experiment's intensity was re-calibrated in 2010, we hypothesized
that our ACI model could still explain the high charge states seen in Xenon
clusters, even with the lower intensities. We included single photon ionization,
impact ionization, ACI and recombination in simulations of Xe$_{90}$ to Xe$_{5083}$
interacting with a 100 fs, 98 nm (12.65 eV) laser pulse at different intensities.
We compared our model
with previous work with ACI disabled and found good agreement. Since these VUV
photons cannot ionize a Xe$^{1+}$ to Xe$^{2+}$ (see table \ref{tab:ips} for Xenon
ionization potentials), all charge states higher than Xe$^{1+}$ must be created
with other processes, in agreement with experiments. The high performance of my
code implementation (see section \ref{section:tools:opencl} on GP-GPU) allowed
running thousands of MD simulations in contrast with other groups where only
a handful of simulations were performed. The chaotic nature of the many-body
problem requires acquiring vast amount of data for valid statistics, giving more
weight to our results. On average, it was found that two more charge states are
accessible when ACI is enabled, a clear indication that ACI has a central role
amongst the ionization channels.

Due to the spacial intensity profile of the laser pulse, simulations were run
at different intensities to simulate the effect of experimental data acquired
from clusters dispersed in the spacial profile. This improves the validity of
simulation data when comparing with experiments. Additionally, our spectrum
was more complete than experiments as they included the neutral Xenon,
inaccessible to the time-of-flight (TOF) apparatus used to collect (real) ions.
Our data was in good agreement with the 2002 experiment. Both the dominant
charge states and the highest charge states matched the experiment data. This
was note the case of other models which used the old intensity.

The last part of the article discuss the influence of the potential depth
of equation~\eqref{eqn:md:sigma}.
% Santra and Greene suggested\cite{Greene2003}
% using atomic potentials instead of a pure Coulombic one to explain the high
% charge states seen in experiments.
By allowing deeper potentials in our
simulations, it was hypothesized that larger charge states could be obtained.
The influence of the potential depth used in simulations is often neglected in
the literature. That article section sheds some light on the topic.
Since electrons are now allowed to go deeper in the ions potential well,
recombination must be used to prevent them from having a total energy less than
the ion's eigenvalues which would not be allowed quantum mechanically.

\fxfatal{Add description of recombination paper}

\subsubsubsection{A quantum approach}

Going further, interesting questions came up. For example, how is a bound
electron's wavefunction affected by a neighbouring ion or the cluster potential?
Due to my background in electromagnetic simulations, I was surprised to read
an article using the FDTD method -- normally used in electrodynamic simulations --
for quantum calculations. I was curious how far could the FDTD method be
applied to quantum problems and if it could answer some of our questions.
A QFDTD simulation package was thus developed, again from scratch,  implementing
two kind of time evolution; real and imaginary. The model and its implementation details
are discussed in section \ref{section:tools:qfdtd}.

The work developed in section \ref{section:tools:qfdtd} was published in the article
``Nonlinear grid mapping applied to an FDTD-based, multi-center 3D
Schr\"odinger equation solver'' presented in section \ref{section:papers:qfdtd}.
Published in 2012 in \textit{Computer Physics Communications}\cite{Bigaouette2011}, it
explains the QFDTD method and its implementation, with emphasis on the new
nonlinear mapping introduced for faster calculation. The QFDTD package is the
first to use both the real and imaginary time evolution, opening the door to
easily get eigenvalues, eigenstates and their time evolution in a time-dependent
and arbitrary spacial shape potential.
The method was first validated by comparing with the analytic solutions of
the hydrogen atom and then applied to solve the H$_{2}^{+}$ molecule.
Comparison with experimental data was in good agreement for the eigenvalues
while the eigenstates could be visualize easily. A new method to calculate
eigenstates is also presented in the article. The publication also
describes in detail the nonlinear mapping that allows reducing both the memory
usage required to store the grid and the time required to calculate the time
evolution. The method is a generic way to obtain a nonuniform grid with cells
concentrated around multi-centres of interest for used in any (finite difference
