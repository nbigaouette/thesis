\subsection{Author contributions}
The MD package was mostly written by N. B. as was the recombination routines.
The ACI cross-sections were calculated by E. A., who also derived the
recombination rates equations. Original text by E. A. Figures were generated by E. A. with scripts originally written by N. B. but heavily modified.
All authors contributed to the discussion.
