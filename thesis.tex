Lay down, your sweet and weary head\\
Night's falling, you've come to journeys end\\  \vspace{10pt}
%
Sleep now, and dream of the ones who came before\\
They are calling from across a distant shore\\  \vspace{10pt}
%
Why do you weep?\\
What are these tears upon your face?\\
Soon you will see all of your fears will pass away\\
Safe in my arms, you're only sleeping\\  \vspace{10pt}
%
What can you see on the horizon?\\
Why do the white gulls call?\\
Across the sea a pale moon rises\\
The ships have come to carry you home\\  \vspace{10pt}
%
And all will turn to silver glass\\
A light on the water, all souls pass\\  \vspace{10pt}
%
Hope fades, into the world of night\\
Through shadows falling out of memory and time\\  \vspace{10pt}
%
Don't say, we have come now to the end\\
White shores are calling\\
You and I will meet again\\
And you'll be here in my arms, just sleeping\\  \vspace{10pt}
