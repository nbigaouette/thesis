\subsection{Author contributions}
The MD package was mostly written by N. B. Most post processing scripts used to
analyze data and generate figures were written by N. B. and tweaked by E. A.
The article text was written by E. A. with some corrections by N. B. Data
acquisition was done by both N. B. and E. A. All authors contributed to the
discussion.
