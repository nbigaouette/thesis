\subsection{Molecular Dynamics (MD)}
\label{section:tools:md}


\lrfatal{somewhere you should mention that the order (N2) scaling is only for
long range potentials. for short range potentials, the scaling is order (N), so
we should be clear here that in this thesis, we're interested in long range (ie,
coulomb)}

\lrfatal{you may also want to mention somewhere that we are treating ions and
electrons, and that ions have different charge states possible. and that we
choose our ion potentials so that they scale - so that a +3 ion + electron on
top looks like a +2, for example.}

Due to the high charge states seen in experiments with clusters the most
practical method to microscopically study the ionization dynamics is
\textit{Molecular Dynamics} (MD) methods where ions and electrons are treated
classically.

In MD, bodies interact directly through classical instantaneous forces. Even
though the method's name contains the term ``molecular'', these forces can be
of any nature; gravitational, van der Waals, Lennard-Jones, electrostatic, etc.
The method numerically integrates Newton's equations of motion, resulting in a
time evolution of the system.

The total force acting on particle $i$ of mass $m_i$ from all other $N$
particles in the system is:
\begin{align}
m_i \va_i & = \vF_i = \sum_{j \ne i} \vF_{j \rightarrow i}
\label{eqn:md:newton}
\end{align}

\lrnote{the above is only for two-body interactions. you can do MD with more
than two-body interactions - remember when we were looking at Silicon years
ago, it's 3 body, for example -  so i would specifically say it's for a
two-body interaction}

In the present work, the force between charged particles is the instantaneous
electrostatic Coulomb force:
\begin{align}
\vF_{C,j \rightarrow i}\pa{\vr} & =\frac{k q_i q_j}{r_{ji}^2} \hvr_{ji}.
\label{eqn:md:coulomb:F}
\end{align}
which only depends on the distance between particles. Figure
\ref{fig:md:vectors} shows the vectors definition used throughout this work. We
define particle $i$ the particle we are interested in (for example, the
particle we are calculating the force on), and particle $j$ the particle that
is generating the field or potential that is measured at location of particle
$i$. We thus have:
\begin{align}
\vr_{j} + \vr_{j,i} & = \vr_{i} \\
\vr_{j,i} & = \vr_{i} - \vr_{j} \\
\hvr_{j,i} & = \frac{\vr_{j,i}}{\abs{\vr_{j,i}}}
\end{align}

%       /|\
%  r_j /   \ r_ji
%     /    _\/
%    /------>i

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{figures/vectors}
 \caption{\label{fig:md:vectors}Vectors definition between particles $i$ and $j$}
\end{figure}
%
%
Equation \eqref{eqn:md:newton} can be time integrated for every particles
$i$ using the Velocity-Verlet~(VV) scheme:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:md:vv}
\begin{align}
\vx_{i}^{\pa{n+1}} & = \vx_{i}^{\pa{n}} + \vv_{i}^{\pa{n}} \Delta t +
\frac{\va_{i}^{\pa{n}}}{2} \Delta t^2, \\
\va_{i}^{\pa{n+1}} & = \frac{\vF^{\pa{n}}}{m_i} \label{eqn:md:vv:a} \\
\vv_{i}^{\pa{n+1}} & = \vv_{i}^{\pa{n}} + \frac{\va_{i}^{\pa{n}} +
\va_{i}^{\pa{n+1}}}{2} \Delta t,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\Delta t$ is the integration time step, $\vx_{i}$ the position vector,
$\vv_{i}$ the velocity vector and $\va_{i}$ the acceleration vector, all evaluated
for particle $i$ at either the time step $n$ or the next one $n+1$.
Equations \eqref{eqn:md:vv}, when applied to every particle $i$ of the system,
can thus be used to propagate in time the whole cluster.

Every particle in the system stores its position $\vx^{\pa{n}}$, its velocity
$\vv^{\pa{n}}$ and also the total force acting on it $\vF^{\pa{n}}$. This total
force is the sum of all contribution of equation \eqref{eqn:md:coulomb:F} from
all other particles in the system.

The MD algorithm basically calculates the force between every pair of particles
in the system. Since there are $N$ total particles, there are $O\pa{N^2}$
interactions to calculate. Doubling the number of particles will quadruple the
computational burden, effectively putting an upper limit on the number of
particles that can be simulated to tens of thousands.

An example cluster can be seen on figure \ref{fig:md:cluster}.
This cluster is comprised
of 147 xenon atoms (large blue spheres) and absorbs some photons (red
wave-packets) from the laser field. Atoms are ionized; electron are created
(small grey spheres) which moves through the cluster. Ions are represented with
colours going from blue for neutral to red for Xe$^{5+}$. The figure was
generated using
PyMOL\footnote{\textit{The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System}, Version 1.5.0.4,
Schrödinger, LLC. \url{http://pymol.org/}} on actual simulation-created data.

          field are displayed as red wave-packets.}

\subsection{Short range potential shapes}
\label{section:intro:md:potentials}

An important problem to consider is the close range behaviour of the Coulomb force
in equation \eqref{eqn:md:coulomb:F} which diverges. The problem is resolved by
changing the shape of equation \eqref{eqn:md:coulomb:F} at close range.
Different \textit{smoothing potentials} can be used to prevent the
discontinuity of the Coulomb potential (or force).

Additionally, from a quantum mechanical point-of-view, electrons should not be
able to classically recombine to an ion below the ground state energy.
A softened potential also prevents the electron from falling too deep within the
potential well of an ion. If this were to happen, the cluster as a whole would
become artificially heated. However, as we will see in chapter
\ref{section:papers:100nm}, it can be
important to account for the effect of a deeper potential on a hot electron. To
account for this, and still prevent artificial cluster heating, we have
implemented electron recombination to the ground state, as described in section
\ref{section:intro:mechanisms}.

Different potential shapes were investigated for the close range potential.
Figure~\ref{fig:potential:shapes} plots the different shapes of potentials and
their respective electrostatic field. These shapes are obtained by simply
finding the location $R$ where the value and the slope of the close-range shape
$\phi_{cr}$ fits with the Coulomb potential $\phi_C$.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\left. \phi_C        \right|_{R} & = \left. \phi_{cr} \right|_{R} \\
\left. \delr{\phi_C} \right|_{R} & = \left. \delr{\phi_{cr}} \right|_{R}
\end{align}
\label{eqn:potential:to_match}
\end{subequations}

These locations $R$ are the cutoff radius of these shapes and mark the switch
between the long range Coulomb potential and the short range potential.


\subsubsection{Harmonic}

For the harmonic potential, we have:
\begin{align}
\phi_{j,H} & = -A r^2 + \phi_0
\end{align}
We note that at $r_{j,i} = 0$, the potential value is the ``potential depth''
$\phi_0$.
Matching equations \eqref{eqn:potential:to_match} at $R$ gives:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\phi_{j,H}\pa{\vr_i} & = \frac{-4 \phi_0^3}{27 \pa{k q_j}^2} r_{j,i}^2 + \phi_0
\\
R & = \frac{3 k q_j}{2 \phi_0} \\
\vE_{j,H}\pa{\vr_i} & = \frac{k q_j}{R^3} \vr_{j,i}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}


\subsubsection{Super-Gaussian}

The super-gaussian potential is given by:
\begin{align}
\phi_{j,SG}\pa{\vr_i} & = \phi_0 \ex{
                            -\frac{1}{2} \pa{\frac{r_{j,i}}{\sigma}}^{2m}
                        }
\label{eqn:potential:shapes:sg:pot}
\end{align}
In the case where $m = 1$, equation \eqref{eqn:potential:shapes:sg:pot} is simply
a gaussian shape. Matching equations~\eqref{eqn:potential:to_match} at $R$ gives
values for $\sigma$ and $R$:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\sigma  & = \frac{k q_j m^{1/2m}}{\phi_0} \ex{\frac{1}{2m}} \\
R       & = \frac{k q_j}{\phi_0} \ex{\frac{1}{2m}} \\
\vE_{j,SG} & = \frac{\phi_0 m}{r_{j,i}}
                \ex{-\frac{1}{2} \pa{\frac{r_{j,i}}{\sigma}}^{2m}}
                \pa{ \frac{r_{j,i}}{\sigma} }^{2m}
                \hvr_{j,i}
\end{align}
\label{eqn:potential:shapes:sg}
\end{subequations}





\subsubsection{Gaussian distribution}

An efficient way to correct the close range problem is to treat electrons as
charge distributions instead of point particles. There is thus no
discontinuity when the two charged distribution (particles) overlap. As such,
the electrostatic potential due to a charged particle $j$
(of gaussian shape of width $\sigma$) at location $\vr = r \hvr$ is
\begin{align}
\phi_{j}\pa{\vr} & = \frac{k q_j}{r} \erf{\frac{r}{\sigma \sqrt{2}}}
\label{eqn:md:smoothed:phi}
\end{align}
where $\erf{}$ is the error function. The associated electrostatic field is thus
\begin{align}
\vE_{j}\pa{\vr} & = -\grad{\phi_j\pa{\vr}} = k q_j \pa{
    \frac{ \erf{\frac{r}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}} }{r^2}
    - \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{ \ex{-\frac{r^2}{2 \sigma^2}} }{\sigma r}
} \hvr.
\label{eqn:md:smoothed:E}
\end{align}
When the distance $r$ is large compared to $\sigma$, the error function
is tends towards 1 and the exponential tends towards 0 (since it's a gaussian
shape). The potential \eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:phi} and electric field
\eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:E} thus tend towards Coulombic for large distances.

The value of $\sigma$ is arbitrary: the smaller it is, the closer the potential
will be from the pure Coulomb one. We can set a value for $\sigma$ from the
extremum value of the potential which occurs at $\vr = 0$. At $\vr = 0$, an
indetermination $\frac{0}{0}$ occurs. Using l'Hospital rule, we get the limit
of $\phi$ as $\vr$ reaches 0:
\begin{align}
\lim_{\vr \rightarrow 0} \phi_j\pa{\vr}
    & \equiv \phi_j\pa{0} = \frac{ k q_j }{ \sigma } \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}
\label{eqn:md:smoothed:phi0}
\end{align}
from which we get the particle width:
\begin{align}
\sigma & = \frac{ k q_j }{ \phi_j\pa{0} } \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\pi}}.
\label{eqn:md:sigma}
\end{align}
The free parameter is thus the ``potential depth'' $\phi_j\pa{0}$. Even
though $\phi_j\pa{0} > 0$ we call this parameter ``depth'' since the potential
energy of an electron on top of an ion would be minimum, similar to the
gravitational potential energy of a ball is minimum at the bottom of a well.

Another problem that the smoothing of equations \eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:phi} and
\eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:E} solve is the one of \textit{numerical heating} which
occurs when particles artificially gain (or loose) energy during the
calculation of equations \eqref{eqn:md:vv}. This absence of conservation of
energy is due to a too large time step $\Delta t$. Indeed, the
discretization of equations \eqref{eqn:md:vv}, and most importantly of
subequation \eqref{eqn:md:vv:a}, assumes the force on each particle to have a
linear variation between time steps. If the time step is too large and the
curvature of equation \eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:E} cannot be sampled by the moving
particle between each time steps, then the energy will not be conserved.



Figure \ref{fig:potential:shapes} show the different potential shapes and their
respective electrostatic field.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{figures/potential_shapes}
 \caption{\label{fig:potential:shapes}Potential shapes and their respective
          electric field. Note the use of atomic units and the potential depth
          $\phi_0$ = 1.5 Hartree = 40.8 eV.}
\end{figure}

It was found that the potential given by the charge distribution of equation
\eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:phi} and the associated electrostatic field of
\eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:E} give the least numerical heating. As explained
previously, the time discretization used to integrate the equations of motion
assumes that the change in force between two time steps is linear. As can be
seen on figure \ref{fig:potential:shapes}, the charge distribution curve
(magenta) does not have a discontinuity and is therefore the prefered one.

To validate the selection of the smoothing curve, photo-ionization was forced
on a single atom and the total energy calculated. In this ionization case, the
electron comes out of the ion with a maximum of kinetic energy so that
its total energy is the difference between the photon energy and the ionization
potential. It is thus a good candidate for a quantitative measurment of
numerical heating. If the total
energy is conserved, then the selected parameters (potential depth, smoothing
curve and time step) can be used with good confidence. Figures
\ref{fig:potential:heating:dt} and \ref{fig:potential:heating:depth} show the
energy variation of the process as a function of time step (for different
potential depths) and as a function of potential depth (for different time
steps). A time step of 0.5 attosecond is often taken as
it minimizes the energy variation for a large
range of potential depths, as can be seen on figure
\ref{fig:potential:heating:depth}.
It is important to note that a better precision is not obtained by going
under $\Delta~t~\approx~0.05~\textrm{as}$ as can be seen on figure
\ref{fig:potential:heating:dt}. This is caused by the precision of the computer.
While it is normal that such a limit exist, it is relatively high due to the
actual code implementation. Indeed, the dynamical aspect of the code is
implemented in SI units when large differences between numbers can be easily
obtained. When these numbers are combined in the algorithm's implementation,
the computer floating point precision is not enough. Nevertheless, a time-step
of 0.05~as is sufficient for the work. The specific
parameters (time step and potential depth) are specified in the different
studies in later sections.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Look-up tables}
\label{section:intro:md:potentials:lut}

The preferred potential shape, the Gaussian distribution described previously,
uses the error function which has a major
computational issue: it is slow, or at least too slow to be called at each interaction pair
calculation. I was decided to implement a look-up table instead.
The potential and field functions are pre-calculated for a charge state of 1+.
Since both potential and field are linear in charge (the potential caused by a 2+
ion is twice the one of a 1+), their value for any
particle is simply scaled by its charge state.

Once the potential and field curves are calculated, they are approximated using
\begin{align}
x_{\textrm{norm}} & = \frac{x}{\Delta x} \\
i   & = \textrm{int}\pa{x_{\textrm{norm}}} \\
A   &= lut\cro{i} + \pa{lut\cro{i+1}-lut\cro{i}} \pa{x_{\textrm{norm}}-\textrm{double}\pa{i}}
\end{align}
where $x$ is the distance between the two particles, $lut$ is the array
containing the look-up table, $i$ the index of the look-up table and $A$ the
value to approximate using the look-up table.

The OpenCL implementation is different. The look-up tables are first transferred
to the OpenCL device where they will be indexed using:
\begin{align}
x_{\textrm{norm}} & = \frac{x}{\Delta x} \\
i   & = \textrm{convert\_int\_sat\_rtz}\pa{\textrm{floor}\pa{x_{\textrm{norm}}}} \\
A   &= lut\cro{i} + \pa{lut\cro{i+1}-lut\cro{i}} \pa{x_{\textrm{norm}}-\textrm{convert\_float}\pa{i}}
\end{align}
The OpenCL function
convert\_float() converts an integer to a floating point value
and convert\_int\_sat\_rtz() converts a floating point to an integer,
rounding towards zero (\_rtz) and saturating (\_sat) the conversion in case of
out-of-range
\footnote{\url{https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/convert_T.html}}
(if the floating point value exceed the range of the integer type,
the maximum value for the integer is used instead of a dangerous undefined
behaviour).

This effectively does a linear interpolation between the look-up table values.
In the present work, 10,000 points are used for the table with a maximum value
for $x$ at the potential shape cutoff distance. In the case of the gaussian
distribution shape, four times the particle width $\sigma$ is used as the cutoff
distance.




\subsection{Long range potential: Hierarchical Tree algorithms}

The $O\pa{N^2}$ scaling of the MD algorithm for long-range forces
can be problematic when the number of
particles simulated is more than many thousands, which is a potential target
for laser-cluster interaction. Some interesting variations of the MD algorithm
exist to reduce the computational burden. One class of methods uses
\textit{hierarchical tree}
algorithms as introduced by Barnes and Hut in 1986\cite{Barnes1986}. To
reduce the computational burden, particles are grouped in a hierarchical tree
(quadtree in two dimensions, octree in three). While Barnes used his
\textit{treecode} to solve the N-body problem in the context of gravitational
interactions, it can also be applied in the electrostatic case.

The main issue with the direct calculation of forces in MD is the lack of
distinction between the close particles and distant ones. While the resulting
potential of a distant particle is small, the computational cost required to
calculate it is the same as in the case of a nearby particle. Some MD
calculations use an artificial cutoff: particles farther then this cutoff will
be ignored in the calculation of the force on one particle. This is acceptable
when the force acting on particles is short range, either due to screening or
to the nature of the force (Lennard-Jones for example).
In the present work, the dominant force is the
Coulomb force and is a long range one by nature; it thus cannot be artificially
cutoff as in the case of close range forces used in other fields.

Could distant particles be grouped together, with their contribution to the
force (or potential) being calculated only once (per ``group'')? Because
individual particles which are part of a distant group will have a similar
contribution to the potential at the location of particle $i$, the interaction
with this group can be instead approximated through the multipole
expansion\cite{Gibbon2002} of the group of particles, or cell in terms of the
tree algorithm:
\begin{align}
\phi_i & = \sum_{j~\textrm{cell}} \phi_{j \rightarrow i} = \sum_{j~{\rm cell}}
\frac{k q_j}{r_{ji}} \\
& \approx \frac{M_{c}}{R}
+ \sum_{\alpha} \frac{r_{\alpha} D_{c,\alpha}}{R^3}
+ \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \frac{
        Q_{c,\alpha,\beta} r_{\alpha} r_{\beta}
    }{R^5}
\end{align}
where $M_{c}$, $D_{c,\alpha}$ and $Q_{c,\alpha,\beta}$ are the monopole, dipole
and quadrupole moments of the cell defined as:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
M_{c}           ~~~~& = \sum_{j~\textrm{cell}} q_{j} \\
D_{c,\alpha}      ~~& = \sum_{j~\textrm{cell}} q_{j} r_{j,\alpha} \\
Q_{c,\alpha,\beta}  & = \sum_{j~\textrm{cell}} q_{j} \pa{3 r_{j,\alpha}
r_{j,\beta} - r_{j}^2} \delta_{\alpha,\beta}
\end{align}
\label{eqn:tree:moments}
\end{subequations}
and $R$ is the distance between the cell's centre-of-charge and the
particle of interest $i$.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{figures/quadtree}
 \caption{\label{fig:tree:quadtree}Quadtree: 2D's equivalent of the 3D octree.
          300 particles (half ions in blue, half electrons in magenta) represent
          an exploding cluster. Cells' moments are propagated up the tree to the
          root cell. Particles far from a cell can interact directly with it
          instead of resolving all particles contained in it, thus reducing the
          computational burden.}
\end{figure}


The tree algorithm first split the computational domain into an octree (in
three dimension) or quadtree (in two dimensions) until
only a maximum of one particle is present per cell as can be seen figure
\ref{fig:tree:quadtree}. The deepest cells of the tree, containing only one particle,
are called leaves. Once every particle in the system is inserted in the tree,
the electrostatic moments are propagated from the leaves up to the root cell,
the top cell enclosing the whole domain.

Then, instead of iterating through all particles for the calculation of the
force on the particle of interest $i$, the tree is traversed. If the cell is
``far enough'' (with a given definition of far enough, discussed next) it can
be added to the a cell interaction list for later processing through the cell's
moments. In the case of
the cell being too close, it must be resolved into its  eight \textit{daughter}
cells (or four in 2D). The daughter cells containing particles are visited, while the empty
ones are ignored. The leaf cells can be reached using this process; in this
case, the particles in the leaves are considered close enough to the particle
of interest $i$ and a direct interaction is wanted. The leaf particle will thus
be added to a second interaction list containing particle-particle direct
interactions. The process is recursively repeated until all particles
are added to an interaction list, either directly or through a parent cell.
Note that an optimization done in the
implementation is to allow many particles per leaves and automatically add them
to the particles interaction list when traversing the tree, preventing trees
which are overly unbalanced.

Different selection rules exist for the criteria of ``far enough''. These
rules are called \textit{Multipole Acceptance Criteria} or
MAC\cite{Pfalzner1996}. Barnes' original one simply referred as
``\textit{s/d}'' compares an input parameter $\theta$ with the cell's size $s$
divided by the distance between the cell's center-of-charge and particle of
interest $i$ (see figure \ref{fig:tree:mac:1}).
If the ratio $s/d$ is smaller than the parameter $\theta$, the
group of particles contained inside the cell is approximated through the cell's
moments and the cell is added to the cells interaction list. At the opposite, if
the ratio is larger than $\theta$, the cell will be resolved into its daughters.
In the limit where $\theta$ reaches zero, no more cells are added to the
cells interaction list (they are all resolved) and the MD algorithm emerges, though
with a large overhead due to the tree construction and traversal.

Unfortunately, this MAC can cause huge errors when large amount of charge is
present in a corner of a cell\cite{Pfalzner1996}.
% Page 85 (97), figure 4.13
In this case, a cell could be added to the cell
interaction list even though the error introduced by the multipole expansion is
significant. Different MAC have thus been proposed to mitigate this problem.
The \textit{minimum distance} MAC replaces the distance $d$ in the MAC with the
minimum distance to one of the cell's edge (figure \ref{fig:tree:mac:2}).
The \textit{B-max} MAC instead
replaces the size of the cell with the largest distance between one of the
cell's corner to the center-of-charge (figure \ref{fig:tree:mac:3}).
Another MAC was proposed by
B\'edorf~\textit{et.~al.}~\cite{Bedorf2012} and is a mix of the two previous.
The MAC reads:
\begin{align}
d > \frac{s}{\theta} + \delta
\end{align}
where $\delta$ is the distance between the cell's geometric center and its
center-of-charge (figure \ref{fig:tree:mac:4}).
If the previous equation holds ($d$ is large enough) then the
multipole expansion is used and the cell is added to the interaction list.

\end{figure}


Because not all interaction pairs are considered in the calculation of the
force and potential in this tree algorithm,
a significant speedup is obtained. Due to the tree
traversal algorithm, the scaling improves
from $O\pa{N^2}$ to $O\pa{N \log{N}}$\cite{Barnes1986,Gibbon2002,Pfalzner1996}.

A variation to the hierarchical treecode is obtained when a sufficiently large
$\theta$ is used. In this case, the root cell (the largest one) is never
resolved into its daughters. By adding more moments to the approximation then
the first three ones of equations \eqref{eqn:tree:moments} and removing
contributions of nearby particles, the \textit{Fast Multipole Method} (FMM) is
obtained\cite{Pfalzner1996}. FMM was developed by Greegard in
1988\cite{Greengard1987} independently of Barnes' hierarchical tree method.
While conceptually similar, its implementation details are quite different and
has not been implemented in the current work while the hierarchical tree
algorithm was.



\subsection{Implementation details}

\subsubsection{MD code}

Our group previously used Barnes and Hut's treecode implementation,
freely available\cite{treecode} (through the GPL version 2 license). The code was adapted
to simulate charged particles (Coulomb force) instead of masses (gravitational
force) with some ionization routines added (see for example reference
\cite{Jungreuthmayer2005}). While reducing development time by re-using already
written code, the maintenance burden introduced by many factors (initial
implementation written in the C language, usage of global variables
throughout the code, multiple coding styles from different people throughout
the years, lack of revision control system to give the freedom
of deleting code from the active version without loosing the ability to roll
back, many subtle and important bugs, stability issues, etc.) pushed me
to restart from scratch. This allowed using modern development techniques to be
used. For example, all development was done through a revision control system
(subversion\cite{svn} at first, then switched to git\cite{git}) in the C++
language instead of C. The object oriented nature of C++ allowed encapsulation
of different parts of the code which could then be tested and validated
individually through unit testing. This gave much better flexibility to the
code, a required asset to
push further the development of features.

A substantial number of MD packages are freely available and
their usage was considered instead of re-implementing a new one from scratch.
Examples are GROMACS\footnote{GROMACS:
\url{http://www.gromacs.org/}}, NAMD\footnote{NAMD:
\url{http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}} and
LAMMPS\footnote{\url{http://lammps.sandia.gov/}}. A major issue with these
pre-existing MD packages is their target audience; they aim to simulate large
bio-molecules with mostly short range interactions. Another important problem
is the number of particles throughout the simulations; while many packages
assume a constant number of particles, the present work required creating
(ionization) and annihilating (recombination) particles throughout simulations.
Controlling the MD part of the code allowed better integration of the
ionization aspects.

Additionally, other MD packages were not mature enough or simply non-existent at the time.
For example the largely used HOOMD-blue\footnote{HOOMD-blue:
\url{http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/}} which uses extensively
Nvidia GPUs released its first version (v0.6.0) in February 2008.
Additionally, the knowledge and experience gained by writing from scratch such
a package is invaluable.



\lrfatal{need to have much better flow to the next section. an introductory
paragraph of something. It's really jarring. perhaps move the MD implementation
into the previous section somehow, and make the below on the implementation
details of the quantum rates??}


\subsubsection{Potential threshold $V_b$}
\label{section:intro:Vb}

Many ionization processes described in the introduction
consider an isolated atom but
clusters have close to solid density (10$^{22}$ -- 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-3}$) and
so the environment cannot be ignored.

The cluster environment can be approximated by a constant value that shifts the
potential\cite{Fennel2007}. This shift is $U_b = -e_0 V_b$ where $V_b$ is the
potential due to the cluster at the ion's location (ignoring nearby electrons)
and $U_b$ is the potential energy a test particle of charge state -1 (an electron)
would have if it was placed right on top of the ion. This can be justified by
the fact that bound states of rare gas atoms are localized close to the nucleus
and the cluster potential spatial variation around atoms is small.

To illustrate this shifting, figure \ref{fig:md:Vb} shows the potential energy
landscape of an example ``cluster'' of two ions. Plotted on this figure is the
potential energy of a test particle of charge state -1 (an electron) in the
cluster environment. The contribution from the ion is the blue dashed line on the
figure. Note the distinction between potential and potential
energy. A positive charge (an ion) creates a positive potential but the
potential \textit{energy} of the test particle (of charge state -1) in that
positive potential is negative, hence the negative curves on figure
\ref{fig:md:Vb}.



\begin{figure}
    % ./potential_landscape.py --two --ion="0,1" --ion="-15,5" --impe_r=4 \
    %     --depth=1.5 --ion_impe=0 --impe_K=0.75 --ionization --umin=-1.2 \
    %     --umax=0.3 --plot=all --rmin=-7 --rmax=7.5 --plot=U
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{figures/potential_landscape}
    \end{center}
    \caption{\label{fig:md:Vb}Cluster environment potential energy landscape
             and the $U_b$ approximation. A 1+ ion at $r=0$ and a 5+ at
             $r=-15$~Bohr. The potential energy curves are those of a test
             particle of charge state -1 (electron). See text for curves
             description.}
\end{figure}


Continuing in the example case of figure \ref{fig:md:Vb}, we introduce a
second ion as an example of the simplest cluster environment. This second ion, of
charge state 5+ in this example and located at $r$~=~-15 Bohr, is creating a
potential that is not constant around the first ion (red-dashed line). The potential energy of
the test particle in this potential is plotted as the red dashed line. The total
potential energy of the test particle due to the two ions is plotted as a black
dashed line.

The first ion's threshold is thus influenced by the second ion. The continuum,
instead of being at zero, is shifted by $U_b$. This approximates the
influence of the second ion as being constant in the first ion's vicinity. This
threshold shift is shown on figure \ref{fig:md:Vb} as the red arrow $U_b$.

The effect of $U_b$ is to shift the ion's states to lower energies. This is
shown on the figure as Ip$_{ion}$, the energy required for a bound electron
to be promoted to the isolated ion's continuum, being shifted downward to
Ip$_{ion}'$. The effective ion's potential energy curve, also shifted by $U_b$,
is shown as the dotted blue line.

This cluster potential $U_b$ is then treated as the atom's threshold
to continuum. By using $U_b$ as the threshold, atomic properties such as
impact ionization cross-sections can be used, even in the cluster environment.



\subsubsection{Notes on ionization definition}
\label{section:intro:mechanisms:notes}

Special care needs to be taken when calculating particle energies during
ionization processes. In this work, an ionization event is defined as one
electron that leaves its parent ion, reaching infinity with a final kinetic
energy of zero.

\lrfatal{this is *not true* within the cluster environment, but only in the
isolated atom picture. in the cluster environment, don't we use Vb?}

\subsubsubsection{Single photon ionization}

In the case of single photon ionization, a new electron is created right on top
of the ion with an updated charge state. At this point, all other particles in
the cluster will not see the difference the potential created by this new
particles pair $\frac{Z+1}{r} - \frac{1}{r}$ is the same as the previous ion's
$Z/r$.
\lrfatal[noinline,margin]{refer to what it really is, with the softened potentials!}
For the new electron to reach infinity with a null kinetic energy, it
must have, at its creation time, enough kinetic energy to leave the ion. This
kinetic energy must thus match the potential energy between the ion (with an
updated charge state) and the electron so the total energy of the electron with
respect to the ion is zero.

Additionally, the electron will contain in its kinetic energy the difference
between the absorbed photon and the ionization potential of the ion.

\lrfatal{stress that this zero at infinity is only for the isolated atom case,
and that in the cluster environment it's influenced by Vb. because except for
the very first ionization (where all are neutral, so there is no Vb), this will
NOT be true for a cluster.}

\subsubsubsection{Impact ionization}

For impact ionization, the impacting electron's kinetic energy used in equation
\eqref{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz} is the kinetic energy the electron has
\textit{at infinity}, meaning that the impacting electron and the atom (or ion)
are isolated from each other.

\lrfatal{please clarify that the above and below paragraphs are only for the isolated atom case}

At infinity, the electron's total energy only contains kinetic
energy. We call this kinetic energy $K_{\textrm{thresh}}$ for ``kinetic energy
above the threshold''. This $K_{\textrm{thresh}}$ can simply be calculated
as $K_{\textrm{thresh}} = \textrm{max}\pa{0, K_e + U_e}$
where $K_e$ is the
electron's kinetic energy and $U_e$ its potential energy with respect to the ion.
$K_{\textrm{thresh}}$ is thus the electron's total energy \textit{with respect
to the ion}.
In the case of a classically bound electron, the total energy is less than zero:
the max() enforces a positive kinetic energy.

When a cluster environment is present, a similar approach is taken to obtain
$K_{\textrm{thresh}}$. Instead of taking the extra energy above zero for
$K_{\textrm{thresh}}$, the extra energy above the new threshold $U_b$ is used.
This value can easily be obtained from the actual electron's kinetic energy
$K_e$, it's \textit{total} potential energy in the cluster environment and the
threshold $U_b$ by:
\begin{align}
K_{\textrm{thresh}} & = \textrm{max}\pa{0, K_e + U_e - U_b}
\label{eqn:md:kthresh}
\end{align}
and is shown on figure \ref{fig:md:Vb} as a red arrow with its base at $U_b$.


$K_{\textrm{thresh}}$ is the kinetic energy that must be used in Lotz formula
\eqref{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz}. Cross-sections are discussed in the next
section.


When an impact ionization event occurs and if the impacting electron has more kinetic
energy, it can either keep the extra, give all the extra, or give a fraction of
the extra to the new electron. We split the extra kinetic energy between the two
electrons to assure that they do not fall back into the ion.


% Figure \ref{fig:impact:before:Z} shows the process of impact ionization when an
% electron (particle 1) of charge state -1 impacts an ion (particle 0) of charge
% state Z and creates a new electron (particle 2) right on top.

% \end{figure}


% First, let's assume the impacting electron came from infinity where it's kinetic
% energy was exactly the Ip. In that case, impact ionization will occur (considering
% its impact parameter lies inside the cross-section). By definition, we must have two
% electrons leaving to infinity: an unbound system. Such an unbound system has a total
% energy of 0.
%
% The total energy before (a) is thus:
% \begin{align}
% E^{a} & = K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} = Ip
% \label{eqn:Ea}
% \end{align}
% and after (c) ionization is:
% \begin{align}
% E^{c} & = K_{1}^{c} + K_{2}^{c} + U_{01}^{c} + U_{02}^{c} + U_{12}^{c} = 0
% \label{eqn:Ec}
% \end{align}
%
% The change in energy is thus:
% \begin{align}
% E^{a} - E^{c} & = Ip = K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} - \pa{
%     K_{1}^{c} + K_{2}^{c} + U_{01}^{c} + U_{02}^{c} + U_{12}^{c}
% }
% \end{align}
%
% The only unknown values here are $K_{1}^{c}$ and $K_{2}^{c}$ since the new electron is
% created right on top of the ion. Let's isolate the final kinetic energies:
% \begin{align}
% K_{1}^{c} + K_{2}^{c} = K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} - \pa{
%     U_{01}^{c} + U_{02}^{c} + U_{12}^{c}
% } - Ip
% \label{eqn:K1cPlusK2c}
% \end{align}
%
% We have a single constraint from equation \eqref{eqn:K1cPlusK2c} but two unknown. We thus
% give an arbitrary value to one of the two. We want the new electron to leave the ion.
% Since it is right on top of it, we can guess the required kinetic energy to be very close
% to (minus) the potential energy the electron has with respect to the ion. But this electron
% will be ``pushed'' be the impacting electron too and will thus be accelerated. To compensate
% for this push, we remove the potential energy between the two electrons from the new electron's
% kinetic energy. So the educated guess for the final kinetic energy of the new electron is:
% \begin{align}
% K_{2}^{c} & = -U_{02}^{c} - U_{12}^{c}
% \label{eqn:K2c:pushed}
% \end{align}
%
% Using equation \eqref{eqn:K2c:pushed} in equation \eqref{eqn:K1cPlusK2c} gives:
% \begin{align}
% K_{1}^{c}
%  & = K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} - \pa{
%     U_{01}^{c} + U_{02}^{c} + U_{12}^{c}
% } - Ip - K_{2}^{c} \\
%  & = K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} - \pa{
%     U_{01}^{c} + \cancel{ U_{02}^{c} } + \bcancel{ U_{12}^{c} }
% } - Ip + \cancel{ U_{02}^{c} } + \bcancel{ U_{12}^{c} } \\
% K_{1}^{c}
%  & = K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} - U_{01}^{c} - Ip
% \label{eqn:K1c:pushed}
% \end{align}
%
% The final total energy is then:
% \begin{align}
% E^{c}
%  & = \pa{
%     K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} - \cancel{ U_{01}^{c} } - Ip
%  } - \pa{
%                  \cancel{ U_{02}^{c} } + \bcancel{ U_{12}^{c} }
% } + \cancel{ U_{01}^{c} } + \cancel{ U_{02}^{c} } + \bcancel{ U_{12}^{c} } \\
%  & = K_{1}^{a} + U_{01}^{a} - Ip \\
%  & = Ip - Ip \\
% E^{c} & = 0
% \end{align}
% which is what was expected.






% Additionally, momentum is conserved by giving the two leaving electrons an angle
% of divergence. Since the impacting electron can cause ionization before being
% exactly on top of the atom or ion, the angle of divergence is given by:
%
% Figure \ref{fig:impact:direction} shows the convention of the two angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.

%
% Momentum is conserved in each dimension. In this case, it's a 2-D plane.
% \begin{align}
% \vp^{a} & = \vp^{c} \\
% \vp^{a} & = m_e v_{1x}^{a} \hat{x} \\

%

% \cosine{\phi}   & = \frac{v_{1}^{a} - v_{1}^{c} \cosine{\theta}}{v_{2}^{c}}
% \label{eqn:cos_phi}
% \end{align}
% and in $y$:
% \begin{align}
% 0           & = v_{1y}^{c} + v_{2y}^{c} \\
% 0           & = v_{1}^{c} \sine{\theta} - v_{2}^{c} \sine{\phi} \\

% \label{eqn:cos_theta}
% \end{align}
%
% Equation \eqref{eqn:cos_theta} is used to get $\theta$ from $v_{1}^{a}$ (initial velocity of

% be found using \eqref{eqn:cos_phi}.

\subsubsection{Cross-sections}
\label{section:intro:md:cross-sections}

Implementing any kind of ionization in the model is done through cross-sections.
Because cross-sections can be obtained from experiments for any kind of target,
it is easily integrated into the model.

\subsubsubsection{Single photon ionization}

For single-photon ionization, experimental cross-sections $\sigma\pa{\omega}$
for Xenon were obtained from reference \cite{West1978} and from
reference \cite{Marr1976} for Argon.

Once cross-sections are obtained, they are converted to a rate of ionization
using
\begin{align}
\Gamma\pa{\omega} = \sigma\pa{\omega} I\pa{t}.
\label{eqn:ionization:rate:single}
\end{align}
which is equivalent to equation \eqref{eqn:ionization:rate:mpi} with $\nu = 1$.

Then, this rate is weighted\cite{Lax2006} by the time step size and compared to
a random number $r$ between 0 and 1:
\begin{align}
1 - \e{-\Gamma \Delta t} > r
\label{eqn:ionization:prob}
\end{align}
When the previous test succeeds, ionization takes place and a new electron is
created in the code.
Then, the intensity profile of the laser $I\pa{t}$ is decreased
by one photon
%
to incorporate laser depletion. This is especially important
for a more accurate description of cluster interaction with low fluence pulses.


\subsubsubsection{Collisional processes}

For impact ionization cross-sections, Lotz formula of equation
\eqref{eqn:impact:ionization:lotz} is used with experimental parameters obtained
from reference \cite{Tawara1987} (for neutral xenon)
% Figure 254, page 317
and \cite{Heidenreich2005} (for higher charge states).
% Parameters were taken from figure 1 (a), (b) and (c)
% Note that parameters from figure 1 (a) and (b) for
% the 4+ and 5+ do not give satisfactory results. They were
% obtained by fitting the data directly from the figures
For argon, data from \cite{Lotz1967} and \cite{Lotz1970} is used.
When $K_{\textrm{thresh}} \le 0$, a null cross-section is simply used.

As for ACI, numerical cross-sections from ground state to excited state and from
excited state to continuum were calculated by Edward Ackad using a
Hartree-Fock code from Cowan\cite{Cowan1981,CowanCode}. Only the first eight excited states
were considered (with $l<4$) for charge states up to 17+ for both xenon and argon.

The impact parameter of the impacting electron is calculated by:
\begin{align}
b & = \frac{\abs{\vv \times \vr}}{\abs{\vv}}
\label{eqn:ionization:impact:parameter}
\end{align}
where $\vv$ is the impacting electron's velocity vector and $\vr$ the vector
from the impacting electron to the target. If the impacting parameter lies
inside the calculated cross section, excitation or ionization takes place. In
the case of excitation, the total cross-section of all excited states are used
and a final state randomly selected between all accessible, weighted by their
cross-sections relative to the total one.

\subsubsection{Recombination}

In a classical simulation electrons could cool down into the ions' infinite Coulomb
potential where they would have a total energy less then what is allowed
according to quantum mechanics. This would lead to artificial cluster heating,
as this electron gives up its energy to the cluster as it cools.
Using a smoothing potential as in equation
\eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:phi} will prevent the singularity.
Additionally, if the potential depth $\phi\pa{0}$ used (see
equation \eqref{eqn:md:smoothed:phi0}) is deep enough, the total energy of an
electron might fall below the energy of the state.
Recombination to the ground state is thus used to prevent such nonphysical events.
When an electron's total energy (with respect to the ion) falls below the energy
of the lowest unoccupied state,
recombination is forced: the electron disappears from the simulation and the ion
charge state is increased by one.

Additionally, recombination plays an important role in the dynamics of the
exploding cluster. Experiments at FLASH in 2009 on Xenon clusters in the XUV
regime\cite{Thomas2009} could be reproduced by our models when recombination
was enabled; we found that the lower charge states detected would come from the
cluster core where recombination is important. This study was published in
May 2013's edition of \textit{New Journal of Physics}\cite{Ackad2013} and is
included in this thesis in section \ref{section:papers:recomb}.

Recombination was also required for the work in section
\ref{section:papers:100nm}, as it allowed us to lower the potential depth of the
ions for more physical simulations.
